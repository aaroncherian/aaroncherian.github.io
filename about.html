	Heroic is a multimedia online reading experience. This short story is available to be read online, with pages split up by the mood and tone of the story. As a reader flips through the pages, music will play in the background as a soundtrack to the book, and will change with each page, to further immerse the reader in the story. Examples of books with soundtracks do exist, most notably Booktracks, a website that aids authors in self-publishing a book with their own soundtrack, and similar to the website. The music is self-composed. The intended audience is anyone who loves reading and is interested in the future of books. I hope to present readers with a movie-like experience, looking at not only the future of books and reading, but also the cross-section of music and reading, and their compatibility.
