    <p class = about> If you want a short description of Heroic, here it is: a short story with a soundtrack. It’s that simple. </p>
  <p class = about> <i>Heroic</i> is an exploration of the future of books in digital media, and how we can look at unconventional methods of designing and publishing them. This capstone specifically explores the effect of music on reading, but also invites the reader to wonder about what else could be explored concerning books in an online setting. </p>
  <p class = about> <i>Heroic</i> starts with a short story set in a universe populated, true to its name, by superheroes, which is split into pages over the website.  Now what’s this about a soundtrack you ask? An essential part of this project was a self-composed soundtrack tailored Heroic. Each page of the story has its own piece of music sampled from the soundtrack running in the background that is meant to match the mood and plot of the story. All you have to do is click through the story and listen.
  <p class = about> Part of this project is examining whether a connection can be made between the story and the soundtrack. The music has cues to certain characters, the mood, and the plot that will hopefully help further immerse readers into the story. Or, perhaps it will have the opposite effect. Either way, Heroic is a unique experience that you are invited to try! </p>
  <p class = about> Headphones are highly recommended when reading through the story, and Google Chrome is equally recommended as the browser of choice for this website. </p>
