    <p class = story> “Well I for one, am glad to be here,” Enzo declared, never one to dwell on a topic. “But it is nice not having to worry about suffering near-death wounds every day.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan raised an eyebrow at him. Enzo looked back and sighed. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Can someone please relate to me what a cocked eyebrow means in Bryan-speak again?” </p>
  	<p class = story> “It <i>means</i> that most of the time you were the one rushing into danger and being treated for near-death wounds. The rest of us seemed to manage just fine for the most part.” Ayano jumped in, and Bryan nodded in affirmation. Enzo rolled his eyes, </p>
  	<p class = story> “Ungrateful, the lot of you. I took the hits so you wouldn’t have to,” he muttered, before taking another sip from his drink.  </p>
  <p class = story> Tom felt his attention drawn back to the window once more. He shivered again, and for a moment he thought he could feel the wind and snow against his own face. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah followed his gaze. </p>
   	<p class = story> “You know, the weather was just like this, the last time we were all together,” she mused. The others turned their head now to the window as well. Tom thought back to it, the last time they had all been together, but the memory seemed to slide out of his reach. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Was it really? I don’t remember that.” He said. He frowned then, as he thought on it further, realizing that there were many details that were escaping him. Namely, one very important detail. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Say guys, why was that our last night together?” He asked. </p>
