    <p class = story>“It’s surprising,” he said more solemnly. “There’s a lot about this place that hasn’t changed. I just thought more might have changed in the what, six years we’ve all been apart?” </p>
  <p class = story> “Seven,” Tom corrected him softly. </p>
  <p class = story> “The city still feels the same, oddly enough.” Lilah said. </p>
  <p class = story> “Not exactly. It hasn’t been the same since you guys left,” Tom said. “It just feels… empty, somedays. But that may be because I’m just a strange person.” </p>
  <p class = story> “What? You? Strange? Perish the thought!” Even between mouthfuls of food Enzo found the time to respond. Bryan brought both his hands up to his face, pantomiming a shocked expression. </p>
  <p class = story>Oh had Tom forgotten what it was like having the two of them in one room.</p>
  <p class = story>Lilah raised an eyebrow, and Enzo relented.</p>
   <p class = story> “But why do you think that, all of a sudden?” He asked.</p>
  <p class = story> “I guess, for thinking that a city with a quarter of a million people could ever feel empty,” Tom replied, chuckling at his own self-pity.</p>
  <p class = story>Lilah shook her head. </p>
  <p class = story> “No, it’s not Tom. Our entire team was close, you know, even before Ayano joined. And after she did, we became a unit. If you and Bryan were the brains, and Enzo and I the muscle, then she was the heart of it all,” Lilah said. “So it’s hard, not having the people you depended on around. We understand.”   </p>
  <p class = story><i>We understand.</i></p>
  <p class = story>Just those two words made Tom unexpectedly happy to hear, lifting a certain weight off from him. </p>
