    <p class = story> To say that the existence of a bar specifically catered towards super-powered heroes in the city was a controversial topic would be putting it lightly. To say that certain government officials considered the bar nothing more than a volatile, concentrated mix of powers would be more accurate. Unbeknownst to Tom, the mayor and chief of police would often find their monthly golfing excursions spent lamenting the inevitable, explosive conclusion to such a situation. One that would most certainly cause extensive damage to major parts of the city, which they would no doubt have to spend many sleepless nights dealing with. </p>
  <p class = story> But the results were hard to argue with. The mood was rarely anything but light and cheerful as heroes stepped in from their patrols. They joined their fellow heroes in sharing stories about their time on patrol. The concept made the city more attractive to potential heroes and the sheer amount of power contained in the bar ensured that no rational would-be evildoer would target it. </p>
   <p class = story>  It had always seemed to Tom that the bar was in a constant state of chaos. By the very nature of its customers, powers freely flew around the room at the whim of heroes showing them off. Tom could pick out the newer heroes, like a young lad down below shooting out petals of fire from his hands that danced around in the air. He was no doubt hoping to get the attention of the right heroes, and with a smidge of luck an invitation to join an already established group of heroes on patrol.  Tom could also easily pick out the veterans, who used their powers to keep other heroes in check. </p>
  <p class = story> A woman dressed in an icy-blue costume who lounged in one of the chairs, idly observing the fire-starter, droplets of water frozen in mid-air around her. When the young man’s powers seemed to be getting out of hand, a quick splash of water cooled him down, in both the metaphorical and literal sense. And as other heroes milled in and out, she would lazily flick her hands, and the snow that flew in melted and flowed towards her, keeping heroes dry and, much to the bartender’s delight, the floor as well. </p>
