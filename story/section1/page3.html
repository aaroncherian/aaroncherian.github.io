    <p class = story>Tom found his gaze wandering across the bar. It had come into existence just around the time he had applied to be a hero and was completing the necessary physical examinations.</p>
<p class = story>From its conception, controversy had surrounded the idea of a bar specifically catering to super-powered heroes of the city. Many officials considered the high concentration of individuals with powers in an enclosed space extremely volatile, and that was before alcohol was thrown into the mix. Tom had heard rumors that the mayor and sheriffâ€™s monthly golfing outings usually ended with both wondering whether they would be around to deal with the inevitable fallout from any explosive situations. </p>
<p class = story>The results, however, were hard to argue with. When missions went successfully, fellow heroes would laugh and celebrate together, and when they lost someone they would mourn together as well. The establishment made the city a more attractive place for potential heroes to apply to work, and the sheer amount of power contained in the bar ensured that no rational would-be evildoer would target it.</p>
<p class = story>And no matter how far he traveled from the place, he was always drawn back, an irresistible magnetic pull. He had fond memories of the nights he spent here with his team after patrolling the city; of him, Enzo, Lilah, Ayano and Bryan all seated around the table.</p>
