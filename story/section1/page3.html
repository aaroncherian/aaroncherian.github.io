    <p class = story> Everyone seemed to be in good cheer, though the mood was rarely anything else. And by the very nature of its customers, the bar was constantly in state of chaos. Trays of drinks and food were floating through the air, filled ones moving away from the bartender, while she made another series of movements with her hand to pull empty ones off the various tables towards her. </p>
  <p class = story> Powers were often flying around at random as heroes showed them off. Some heroes displayed their powers to get attention and, if the right people noticed, invitations to join an already established group of heroes on patrol. Tom could immediately pick one out, a young lad holding out his hands, shooting petals of fire that danced around in the air. Other heroes were veterans, and simply showed off their powers for the sake of displaying their mastery of them.   </p>
  <p class = story> One such hero was stealing that spotlight that night. Rivulets of water flowed around her outstretched arms, and as heroes milled in and out, the snow that followed uninvited through the open door melted and swam towards her, putting on a show with the added benefit of keeping the floor dry, much to the bartender's delight. There was good natured cheering throughout the bar as she manipulated the ebb and flow of the liquid. Even after seven years, Tom mused, there was always one hero who was clearly a cut above the rest.  </p>
