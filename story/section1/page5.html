    <p class = story>He saw Lilah glance towards the arriving heroine as well, her face just momentarily wrinkling in annoyance. </p>
<p class = story> “Bad history?” Tom asked her. </p>
<p class = story> Judging by her smile, the question seemed to amuse her. </p>
<p class = story> “Between me and Shard? Nothing you don’t already know of,” she replied, a hint of bitterness to her voice. </p>
<p class = story> Her tone stuck out to Tom as odd. Even though Lilah’s power was towards the fiery end of the spectrum, her temperament was typically anything but. Tom likened being around Lilah to experiencing a cool summer day’s breeze. Calming, relaxing. She could be sharp tongued at times, but always dependable voice of reason.   </p>
<p class = story> “Of course,” Tom lied, not quite remembering where the animosity between the two women had come from, while also reminding himself to ask Bryan or Enzo for a refresher later. </p>
<p class = story> “Sorry Tom,” Lilah continued. “I know the two of you are close, so it can be pretty awkward.” </p>
<p class = story> Tom raised an eyebrow and looked back again to where the woman, Shard apparently being her hero moniker, was sitting with another group of heroes, all of them in costume. He waited to see if he recognized her. </p>
<p class = story> He still drew a blank. </p>
<p class = story> “Maybe not as close as you might be thinking,” he replied. </p>
<p class = story> “No, not like <i>that</i>,” Lilah said, rolling her eyes. “But in a professional capacity the two of you have worked together fairly often, both of you being captains of your own teams and all.” </p>
<p class = story> “Oh right, of course,” Tom said. He would really have to ask Enzo about it later. </p>
