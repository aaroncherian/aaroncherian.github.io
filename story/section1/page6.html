    <p class = story> “Every time!” she said happily, before being swept up in a bear hug by Enzo. Tom stayed in his seat, knowing any effort to move on his part would be pointless. Ayano appeared next to him in the second it took him to put down his glass. </p>
    	<p class = story> “It’s good to see you,” he said, giving her a brief hug. Ayano saluted him, </p>
    	<p class = story> “Likewise cap’n” she said. </p>
    	<p class = story> “<i>Former</i> captain,” Tom corrected. “Besides, I think I should be the one calling you captain now, no? I’ve seen all the headlines about you zipping around the city leading your own patrol.” </p>
    <p class = story> Ayano waved his comment off casually, </p>
    <p class = story> “Oh please no don’t, having my own teammates call me <i>sir</i> and <i>captain</i> and <i>your majesty the fastest person alive</i> is bad enough. I don’t need it from my old teammates either.” </p>
    <p class = story> The woman across the table seemed to choke on her drink the tiniest bit. </p>
    <p class = story> “Come again?” She coughed out. Ayano appeared next to the woman then, squeezing her tightly before replying. </p>
    <p class = story> “Yes, Lilah,” Ayano replied, her face perfectly serious. “I made the executive decision that if I would be called by any name, it should be that one.”  </p>
    <p class = story> “Say how is it you can run so fast when that ego must be weighing you down so much?” Lilah sighed. Ayano simply smiled, leaning over Lilah to fist-bump the man sitting next to her. </p>
    <p class = story> “You doin’ good Bryan?” She asked. Bryan nodded and smiled in response before settling back in the bench. </p>
    <p class = story> “Man, I feel so out of the loop, I want to hear about everything you guys have been up to. Oh and food too! Wait no, give me stories first, then food,” Ayano said.
    <p class = story> Everyone at the table looked at each other expectantly for a second, which was a second too long for Ayano. </p>
    <p class = story> “Oh, come on Lilah, I know you’ve got to have a ton of stories. You didn’t think I wouldn’t hear about you joining one of the most elite strike teams in the city didja?” Ayano asked in turn. “Even if you’re not running as a hero these days, pretty much every hero knows that if Lilah Obi and her flames are getting called in, things are serious.” </p>
    <p class = story> Lilah smiled at the compliment, but shook her head, </p>
    <p class = story> “No, no names or anything. That end of law enforcement is pretty far on the spectrum from the hero job, much stricter protocol to be followed. No codenames, no daily patrols of the city, no costumes, no heroics, just getting called in to take care of the big stuff.” </p>
    <p class = story> “Sounds awful,” Ayano said. Bryan nodded in agreement, and Ayano looked at him questioningly.  </p>
    <p class = story>  “Ah, well, Bryan never likes hearing about me running into danger all the time,” Lilah added, squeezing his hand slightly. </p>
    	<p class = story> “Still up to your magician jigs?” Enzo asked him. </p>
