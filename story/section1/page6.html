    <<p class = story> Bryan tapped the table with his cup, and they all glanced at him. It was courtesy, really, asking permission for him to use his powers on them.</p>
<p class = story> Tom nodded and suddenly felt a slight pressure that always accompanied with Bryan making contact with his mind. A curious feeling it was, as if someone was laying  a warm hand across his forehead, even though there was no real physical sensation at all. He had however, witnessed the physical discomfort that could occur if the telepath needed to know more than just what a person’s surface thoughts were.</p>
<p class = story> A scene started playing in his head, as if his mind was a theater, and he was the audience, watching a movie playing before him. </p>
<p class = story><i>/A small purple flame appearing just above the table Shard was sitting at, high near the ceiling. /</i></p>
<p class = story><i>/The sprinkler, being set off as a result, showered the unfortunate occupants beneath./</i></p>
<p class = story>The images faded and sensation passed. Bryan was failing to wipe a mischievous grin from his face. Lilah laughed and leaned closer into him. </p>
<p class = story> “Ah, my vindictive telepath of a boyfriend. Always coming up with brilliant ideas that involve him sitting back while I do <i>all</i> the work,” she sighed. </p>
<p class = story>The boyfriend in question did his best to feign innocence. </p>
<p class = story> “<i>Or</i>, he’s just being the idea man. Someone has to come up with them,” Enzo countered. Bryan nodded vigorously in agreement. </p>
<p class = story> “You know what Bryan? <i>I</i> appreciate you. Your plan seemed perfect to me,” Enzo assured Bryan, grabbing hold of his hand. Bryan clasped it and bowed his head in gratitude. </p>
