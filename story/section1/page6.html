<p class = story>  “Every time!” she said happily, before being swept up in a bear hug by Enzo. Tom stayed in his seat, knowing any effort to move on his part would be pointless. Ayano appeared next to him in the second it took him to put down his glass. </p>
 <p class = story>  “It’s good to see you,” he said, giving her a brief hug. Ayano saluted him, </p>
 <p class = story>  “Likewise cap’n” she said. </p>
 <p class = story>  “Former captain,” Tom corrected. “Besides, I think I should be the one calling you captain now, no? I’ve seen all the headlines about you zipping around the city leading your own patrol.” </p>
<p class = story>  Ayano waved his comment off casually, </p>
<p class = story>  “Oh please no don’t, having my own teammates call me sir and captain and your majesty the fastest person alive is bad enough. I don’t need it from my old teammates either.” </p>
<p class = story>  The woman across the table choked on her drink the tiniest bit. </p>
<p class = story>  “Your majesty the fastest person alive?” She coughed out. Ayano appeared next to the woman then, squeezing her tightly before replying. </p>
<p class = story>  “Yes, Lilah,” Ayano replied, her face perfectly serious. “I made the executive decision that if I would be called anything, it should be that.”   </p>
<p class = story>  “Say how is it you run so fast and carry around that ego of yours at the same time?” Lilah sighed. </p>
<p class = story>  “Oh, come on Lilah, I know you have to have some names of your own. You didn’t think I wouldn’t hear about you joining one of the most elite strike teams in the city didja?” Ayano asked in turn. “Even if you’re not running as a hero these days, pretty much hero knows that if Lilah Obi and her flames are getting called in, things are serious.” </p>
<p class = story>  Lilah smiled at the compliment, but shook her head, </p>
<p class = story>  “No, no names or anything. That end of law enforcement is pretty far on the spectrum from the hero job, much stricter protocol to be followed. No codenames, no daily patrols of the city, no costumes, no heroics, just getting called in to take care of the big stuff.” </p>
<p class = story>  “Sounds awful,” Ayano said earnestly, while she reached a fist over Lilah to the man sitting next to her who returned the gesture. </p>
<p class = story>  “You doin’ good Bryan?” She asked. Bryan shrugged and made a so-so gesture. </p>
<p class = story>  “Ah, well, as long he’s never been the biggest fan of me running into all the dangerous calls,” Lilah added. “But he’s been staying home to take care of Scarlet, so it works out.” </p>
<p class = story>  “Scarlet! How’s that little scamp doing?” Enzo asked. </p>
