    <p class = story> “Every time!” she said happily, before being swept up in a bear hug by Enzo. Tom stayed in his seat, knowing any effort to move on his part would be pointless. Ayano proved him right, appearing next to him in the second it took him to put down his glass. </p>
  	<p class = story> “It’s good to see you,” he said, giving her a brief hug. Ayano saluted him, </p>
  	<p class = story> “Likewise cap’n” she said. </p>
  	<p class = story> “<i>Former</i> captain,” Tom corrected. “Besides, I think I should be the one calling you captain now, no? I’ve seen all the headlines about you zipping around the city leading your own patrol.” </i>
  <p class = story> Ayano waved his comment off casually, </p>
  <p class = story> “Oh please no don’t, having my own teammates call me <i>sir</i> and <i>captain</i> and <i>your majesty the fastest person alive</i> is bad enough. I don’t need it from my old teammates either.” </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah choked on her drink the tiniest bit. </p>
  <p class = story> “<i>Come again?</i>” She coughed out. Ayano next sped her way to the woman, squeezing her tightly before replying. </p>
  <p class = story> “Yes, Lilah,” Ayano replied, her face perfectly serious. “I made the executive decision that it was the only suitable nickname for someone of extreme importance like myself.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Say how is it you can run so fast when that ego must be weighing you down so much?” Lilah asked sighing. Ayano simply smiled, leaning over Lilah to fist-bump the man sitting next to her. </p>
  <p class = story> “You doin’ good Bryan?” She asked. Bryan nodded and smiled in response, settling back in the bench.</p>
  <p class = story> “Okay, so I need food, but I also want to hear stories. But if I get food then I probably won’t be listening to any of you guys, so it’s probably best to do stories first,” Ayano said. They all looked at each other expectantly a second too long for her. </p>
  <p class = story> “Oh come on,” Ayano complained. “Do I need to do everything myself? Alright, Lilah, I know you’ve got to have a ton of stories. One does not join one of the most elite strike teams in the city without having a few exciting things to talk about.” </p>
  <p class = story> “One also does not tell stories about the missions of an elite strike team without having to kill anyone who heard them shortly afterwards,” Lilah said coyly.</p>
  <p class = story> “Aw, you’re no fun. You gotta tell us something. What’s the life like? Anything like being a hero?” Ayano prodded.</p>
  <p class = story> Lilah shook her head, </p>
  <p class = story> “Not very much at all actually. That end of law enforcement is pretty far on the spectrum from the hero job, much stricter protocol to be followed. No codenames, no daily patrols of the city, no costumes, just getting called in to take care of the big stuff.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Well at least you don’t have to deal with the damn commission system anymore,” Ayano said. </p>
  <p class = story> “They’re still using that system to pay heroes?” Tom laughed. “I don’t envy you Ayano.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Yeah, yeah, whatever you say old man,” Ayano responded. There was silence among all of them for a few seconds. Not an awkward silence, it seemed to Tom, but contemplative. The boisterous conversations around them seemed to grow in volume and flow in around them to fill up the sudden emptiness. Tom looked around the table, and made eye contact with Lilah. Tom couldn’t help but smile back at her. It felt, for the first time in a long time, that everything was right in his world. After a moment, Ayano turned back to Lilah. </p>
  <p class = story> “So you can’t even tell us about one <i>tiny</i> mission?” She pleaded. </p>
  <p class = story>  “Ayano, you might actually be worse than Bryan about this,” Lilah commented, mildly exasperated. “And he can read my mind.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Right, like Bryan would actually read any of <i>our</i> minds,” Enzo chimed in, chuckling. </p>
