    <p class = story>  Tom closed his eyes and thought back to that night. The details were scattered about in his mind. He pulled on them like threads and began to weave them together. As with all things, he decided it was best to start from the beginning of that night. It had begun, he was remembering, like any other night. They had gone to the bar, still dressed in costume, after a patrol shift. Except, he realized, for Ayano, who had not come back to the bar with them. His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden comment from Enzo. </p>

  	<p class = story> “…so now the mayor is being hoisted into the air by a literal whirlwind...” Tom opened his eyes and quite a few things occurred at once. Tom suddenly began to panic as he realized he had no control of his body. He knew that he couldn't move because his first instict when he opened his eyes was to jump ever-so-slightly in his chair, an action that he could not perform. He wanted to jump ever-so-slightly in his chair because the Enzo that was sitting next to him was <i>not</i> the same Enzo he had just seen just a minute prior. </p>
    <p class = story> <i>This</i> Enzo was wearing his hooded costume, black with jagged streaks of blue. Lilah and Bryan were dressed in their's as well, the former wearing her purple suit jacket and black gloves, holding a conductor’s baton in one hand, while the latter was wearing his ghostly white long-jacket, his full face mask laying on the table beside him. Most notably, all of them looked significantly younger. The bar was still largely the same, but it was filled with a different crowd of heroes than he had just seen.</p>
    <p class = story>
      Enzo's statement struck a familiar tone, and the truth began to slowly dawn on Tom. However implausible it may have been, it seemed he was physically living his memory of that night seven years ago.
