    <p class = story> “Say, why was that our last night together?” He asked.
    Enzo gave him a strange look, </p>
    	<p class = story> “Come on, don’t you remember? It was a kinda hard night to forget.” </p>
    	<p class = story> “Tom, how do you forget that night, of all nights?” It was Ayano, but her tone was deadly serious, and there was something else to it. Was it disappointment? </p>
    	<p class = story> “Just close your eyes,” she urged. “Think back.” </p>
    	<p class = story> Tom closed his eyes, and a memory started to form. The details were all there he realized, but scattered, and some just out of reach. He pulled on them like threads, weaving them together. He came to small realizations, like the fact that they had all been dressed in costume that night, coming back to the bar after another patrol, as usual. But no- he realized- Ayano had arrived curiously later than them that night as well, despite having had the same patrol as them. </p>
    	<p class = story> “-so now the mayor is being hoisted into the air by a literal whirlwind-” Tom’s eyes flew open as he heard Enzo speak next to him. Tom became acutely aware of a few things. In the span of the few seconds he had closed, everyone around him had changed into full costume, including himself. He observed Lilah, right across from him, and realized that she looked younger, and upon further inspection realized that everyone at the table looked younger than they had a few seconds ago. The conversation that was going on around him was eerily familiar, and Tom realized with a start that it was a conversation that they had one night, seven years ago. He was, it seemed, literally living his memory. </p>
