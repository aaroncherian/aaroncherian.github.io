  <p class = story> “That long huh?” Lilah said quietly, before smiling and looking over at Tom. “Well thanks for setting this whole thing up Tom, I think I can speak for everyone when I say it’s good to be back.” </p>
	<p class = story> Tom glanced around the table, taking a good look at everyone for the first time that night. There was Enzo, with his embarrassingly loud (and occasionally painful) antics. There was Ayano, whose attention was as always flitting back and forth between whatever was most interesting to her at the moment. Bryan sat quietly, preferring to observe and speak, well, quite frankly never. And then there was Lilah, and Tom couldn’t help but smile back at her. It felt, for the first time in a long time, that everything was right in his world. </p>
