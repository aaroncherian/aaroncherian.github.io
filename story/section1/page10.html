    <p class = story> Bryan gave him a strange look, and the others looked up in surprise. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Tom, how do you forget that night, of all nights?” Ayano asked. Her tone was uncharacteristically serious for her, but tinged with something else. Was it disappointment? </p>
  	<p class = story>  Tom closed his eyes, and the memory started to form. The details were all there he realized, but scattered, and some just out of reach. He pulled on them like threads, weaving them together. Small things, like the fact that they had all been dressed in costume that night, coming back to the bar after another patrol, as usual. But no- he realized- Ayano had arrived curiously later than them that night as well, despite having had the same patrol as them. </p>

  	<p class = story> “…so now the mayor is being hoisted into the air by a literal whirlwind...” Tom’s eyes opened as he heard Enzo speak. <i>This</i> Enzo however, was about seven years younger, wearing his hooded costume, black with jagged streaks of blue. Lilah and Bryan were the same, the former wearing her purple suit jacket a black gloves, holding a conductor’s baton in one hand, while the latter was wearing his ghostly white long-jacket, his full face mask laying on the table beside him. The bar was still lively, but filled with different crowds and heroes. He was living a memory, Tom realized, of that night seven years ago. </p>
