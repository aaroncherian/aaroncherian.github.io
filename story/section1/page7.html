    <p class = story> Tom knew, as well as everyone else at the table that what Enzo said was true. While Bryan’s power was one of the rare ones that was permanently turned on, he would make sure to put in effort to keep his power off around the four of them as a gesture of respect. </p>
  <p class = story> Enzo turned to Bryan. </p>
  	<p class = story> “So, what are you doing while your girlfriend sets fire to every evil doer in sight?” He asked. Lilah rolled her eyes at the question but said nothing. </p>
  <p class = story> Bryan grinned, and Tom felt a slight pressure being exerted on his mind, a momentary sensation that always accompanied Bryan’s powers. A moving image of sorts appeared in Tom’s mind, of screens in front of him filled with computer code that was well-beyond anything Tom had the capacity to understand. </p>
  <p class = story> “From hero to hacker, eh?” Asked Enzo. Bryan sighed and looked over at Lilah, who did her best to hide a smile. </p>
  <p class = story> “For the record, he prefers the mention it as working in the field of computer science,” she said with all the seriousness she could muster. “He thinks it’s a challenge, can’t read the mind of a computer and all you know.” </p>
  <p class = story> Bryan nodded in agreement, before gesturing towards Enzo and Tom. </p>
