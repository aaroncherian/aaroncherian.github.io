    <p class = story> Enzo turned to Bryan. </p>
  <p class = story> “So, what are you doing while your girlfriend threatens every would-be evildoer with fiery retribution?” He asked. Lilah rolled her eyes but said nothing. </p>
  <p class = story> Bryan grinned, and Tom felt a slight pressure being exerted on his mind, a momentary sensation that always accompanied Bryan’s powers. Images appeared in Tom’s mind depicting a government buildings and meetings with several stern-looking people in suits. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan was the rare case of someone whose power was permanently switched on, constantly receiving thoughts and feelings from the people around him. Around the four of them, however, he had promised to push down on his powers as a gesture of respect. Knowing the effort that took Bryan, it was a gesture they all deeply appreciated. </p>
  	<p class = story> His power made him one of the most powerful heroes Tom knew, and it was that same power that somehow rendered Bryan mute, unable to communicate through words, telepathically or verbally. </p>
  <p class = story> “Makes sense, the government would probably want to keep a mind-reader close at hand. Not where I imagined you ending up though,” Ayano said. Tom was surprised at the comment. He thought it was a job that fit Bryan well, but refrained from commenting. </p>
  <p class = story> Bryan shrugged, before gesturing towards Enzo and Tom. </p>
