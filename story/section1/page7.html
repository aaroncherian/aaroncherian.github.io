    <p class = story> Bryan grinned, and Tom felt the feeling of a slight pressure being exerted on his mind, a momentary sensation that always accompanied Bryan’s powers. A moving image appeared in Tom’s head, and for a few seconds he was sitting in the living room of what he knew to be Lilah and Bryan’s house, watching a two-year old go scampering across the floor, before it faded. He was sure that Bryan had sent the others the same image as well. </p>
    <p class = story>  “Ohmygod she’s gotten so big!” Ayano said. “What’s she like? Is it killing you that you can’t read her mind yet? You never could make sense of the minds of anyone under what age was it, five?” </p>
    	<p class = story>  Bryan put up his hands, a position of mock defense, and gestured to Lilah. </p>
    	<p class = story>  “We, well Bryan really, decided before Scarlet was even born,” Lilah completed for him. “He won’t read her mind, the same way he does with ours.” </p>
     <p class = story>  Tom nodded appreciatively. They all knew it was a struggle for Bryan. His always-active power meant he heard the thoughts of anyone in a certain radius around him, but out of respect for them he had promised long ago to shut down his power when it came to their minds. It was a gesture that spoke volumes of his control and his trust in them, considering the effort it took for him to stop using his power. </p>
