    <p class = story> “So you geniuses plan to dump water on the woman who controls it at will?” Lilah interjected.</p>
	<p class = story> Bryan and Enzo promptly released each other. </p>
	<p class = story> “Besides, the sprinkler system has been faulty for far too long. I keep telling them to replace it, but still nothing.” There was a touch of ire to Lilah’s voice. </p>
	<p class = story> “It’s a bar full individuals with powers that spend their days and nights patrolling the streets to fight other less-than-moral individuals with powers as a <i>job</i>,” Tom snorted. “You think the idea of a kitchen fire scares anyone here?” </p>
	<p class = story> “And <i>that’s</i> why they never get fixed,” Lilah retorted. </p>
	<p class = story> “Well you see, I also happen to know someone who’s exceedingly good at controlling fire,” Tom revealed, bringing his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “Maybe even the best, so I feel there’s little to worry about.” </p>
	<p class = story> “Hmm, yes I find your flattery acceptable,” Lilah judged. Her eyes, dark as the wood of an oak tree, had a twinkle in them. She smiled and when she did, for the first time in recent memory, Tom felt whole, a dusty glass being filled after years of disuse. </p>
<p class = story> It was good to be among friends. </p>
<p class = story> Their food arrived shorly. Plates descended onto the center of the table, and Lilah went ahead and passed them to the appropriate person. </p>
<p class = story> “Thank you Jaquelyn!” Tom called out to the bartender, who was surrounded by a swirling vortex of glasses and plates. His voice for the most part faded into the cacophony of chatter in the bar, but she glanced towards him and gave him a small salute. </p>
