    <p class = story> Bryan grinned, and Tom felt the feeling of a slight pressure being exerted on his mind, a momentary sensation that always accompanied Bryan’s powers. A moving image appeared in Tom’s head, and for a few seconds he was looking at kids swarming around Bryan as he stood in a suit, surrounded by floating balloons and streamers, holding out a hand of cards for them to choose from. </p>
<p class = story> “He thinks it’s more of a challenge, performing card tricks and the like for children, since he can’t read the minds of anyone under seven-ish and all” Lilah said, rolling her eyes. </p>
	<p class = story> What Lilah didn’t say, but what everyone tacitly understood was that it was likely more bearable for Bryan as well. He wouldn’t have to work to shut down his power the way he did out of respect for the four of them, nor would he be mentally bombarded by the thoughts of everyone around him in a certain radius. </p>
	<p class = story> “From hero to magician eh?” Enzo replied. “Well cheers to you Bryan!” </p>
<p class = story> Bryan nodded in thanks, and made a sweeping gesture at both Enzo and Tom. </p>
