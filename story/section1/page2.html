    <p class = story> “<i>Excuse me </i> Enzo but there <i>are</i> other people at the table to talk to, if you hadn’t noticed,” came a sharp reply from a woman sitting across the table, an expression of mock outrage on her face. A man sitting next to her was doing his best to look equally affronted. </p>
<p class = story> “It’s the first time in seven years we’ve all been together. You could stand to acknowledge them,” Tom added.
<p class = story>Enzo sighed, before addressing the woman.</p>
<p class = story> “Listen Lilah, often times we must accept some flaws about ourselves,” he said, “I mean we all know that conversation isn’t exactly Bryan’s strong suit.” The man next to Lilah shrugged lazily in agreement.</p>
<p class = story> “Is that right?” Lilah asked, leaning forward. “Do tell me what flaw it is I’m unaware of.”  Her voice was sweet but sharp as a knife. Coinciding with her words, three candles at their table burst into flames, tongues of fire hued a brilliant violet color licking the wicks. Enzo eyed them warily. </p>
<p class = story> “On second thought, you are perfect just as you are,” he replied quickly. Lilah’s smile was only a shade away from being a smirk as she leaned back. Bryan put an arm around her. The fires on the candles went out. </p>
<p class = story> Of the four of them at the table, Tom and Enzo were seated on one side and Lilah and Bryan on another. The two men had spaced themselves across their booth, but Lilah and Bryan had sat closer to each other, intentionally leaving a space empty next to Bryan, a vacant seat which Tom suspected to be the cause of Enzo’s boredom. </p>
<p class = story>Only one person had yet to arrive before they would all be together again. </p>
