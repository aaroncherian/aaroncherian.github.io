    <p class = story> “Can I help you?” Tom asked, mildly exasperated.  </p>
    	<p class = story> “I think she’s here!” Enzo said excitedly, gesturing towards the door. Tom sat up and looked across the bar. The other two occupants of their table, a man and woman sitting across from him, did the same. The woman frowned as they waited for the door to open.</p>
    	<p class = story> “Now Enzo, did you actually see her or are you just guessing as usual?” She asked. Enzo laughed,</p>
    	<p class = story> “Look Lilah, I know none of us would actually see her coming, she’s the fastest woman in the city. But I thought I saw a streak of red go past all the windows and <i>Bryan I can see you rolling your eyes at me and I don't quite understand why.</i>” The last statement was directed towards the man sitting next to Lilah.  </p>
    <p class = story> "Because that's exactly what you said a few minutes ago!” Lilah said, sharing a glance with Bryan. As Enzo and Lilah began their usual course of bickering, Tom found his attention being drawn to the bar as a whole. </p>
