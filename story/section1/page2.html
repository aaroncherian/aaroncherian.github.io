    	<p class = story> “I think she’s here!” he said excitedly. Tom sat up a little straighter and looked across the bar. The other occupants of the table, a man and woman sitting across from him, did the same. The woman frowned as they waited for the door to open.</p>
    	<p class = story> “Now Enzo, did you actually see her or are you just guessing as usual?” She asked, directing her question to the man next to Tom. The man laughed,</p>
    	<p class = story> “Come on Lilah, none of us would actually see her coming, she’s the fastest woman in the city. But I thought I saw a streak of red go past all the windows.” </p>
    <p class = story> “That’s exactly what you said a few minutes ago!” The woman responded. The two began arguing, and in the meantime Tom found his attention being drawn to the bar as a whole. </p>
