  <p class = story>The door chimed as it opened. </p>

  <p class = story>Tom looked up, hoping that Ayano had arrived at last. Instead, another hero stepped through the doorway. Her costume was a light blue, patterned in a way that reminded Tom of ice crystals. Flecks of snow chased her through the open doorway, but as the woman casually brushed off her shoulders, the snowflakes melted into droplets of water that she directed back into the stormy night before shutting the door. </p>

  	<p class = story>In the way that people could be aware when they were being watched, her gaze seemed to lock onto Tom’s. She gave him a nod before walking over to another table, and Tom nodded back out of instinct. It was the kind of gesture that one person would make to recognize the presence of an acquaintance, and even though she looked vaguely familiar, Tom couldn’t pinpoint exactly who she as. Perhaps, they had worked a patrol together back in the day. </p>
