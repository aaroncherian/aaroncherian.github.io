    <p class = story>“Finally!” Enzo exclaimed, slamming a fist down onto the table. “Do you know how bored I was getting waiting for the food?”</p>
	<p class = story>There was a crackle as his fist struck the polished wood, and finally a <i>zap</i>! </p>
	<p class = story>Electricity flickered into existence around his hand before dispersing. </p>
	<p class = story> “<i>Enzo</i>!” Tom growled as a few sparks arced dangerously in his direction. </p>
	<p class = story>Bryan stifled a laugh. </p>
	<p class = story>Enzo shrugged, unapologetic, before proceeding to stab at his food with a knife. </p>
