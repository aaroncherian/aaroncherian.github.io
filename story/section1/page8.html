    <p class = story> “Man, I feel so out of the loop, I want to hear about everything you guys have been up to. Oh and food too! Wait no, give me stories first, then food,” Ayano said. </p>
<p class = story>  Enzo clapped Tom on the shoulder. </p>
<p class = story>  “Well you know we’ve both been out of the whole hero business for a bit, but we’ve been business partners since then. And business has been booming!” </p>
	 <p class = story> “Booming is a strong word,” Tom corrected him slightly. “But it’s been going well enough.” </p>
	<p class = story> “Doesn’t matter!” Enzo said. “We’ve come a long way since we first met, yeah?” </p>
	<p class = story> “Is this the part where you finally tell us how you two met?” Ayano asked. </p>
	<p class = story> “Nope, that’ll always and forever be a mystery,” Enzo replied shaking his head. </p>
	<p class = story> “Someday, Lorenzo, someday you will spill your secrets,” Ayano said, leaning forward to stare Enzo in the eyes for a few seconds, before reclining in her seat again. “Ah, well honestly patrolling the city was never quite the same after all of you guys left.” Her voice was tinged with the barest trace of sadness, before she smiled widely again and continued. “But I’m glad everyone’s been doing well. Say, how long has it been since we were all together anyways? Six years?” </p>
