        <p class = story> Once again, Tom found himself looking out at the window next to him. It was comforting really, to on the longest night of the year be able to look out at the quickly accumulating snow without actually having to be outside in it. He stared out at the rapid crawl of snow and ice across the streets. </p>
  <p class = story> The sky was an endless gray, and even though it was well into the night, he found he could easily see into the night, beyond what was obscured by the snow being pushed past his window. During rare moments of relative quiet in the bar, Tom could hear the low howling of the wind as it drove flecks of white in endless circles and loops. </p>
  <p class = story> He shivered involuntarily as he felt a chill come over him as if he were on the other side of the window looking in. Indeed, being inside the bar was comforting, because the skin-tight costumes of heroes so rarely offered protection against the elements. </p>
  <p class = story> Repeated sharp pokes to his side suddenly snapped him out of his stupor. Tom turned to the man who was sitting next to him at their table.</p>
