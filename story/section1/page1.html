        <p class = story> Once again, Tom found himself looking out at the window next to him. It was comforting really, to on the longest night of the year be able to look out at the quickly accumulating snow without actually having to be outside in it. He stared out at the rapid crawl of snow and ice across the streets. </p>
  <p class = story> The sky was an endless gray, and even though it was well into the night Tom could easily see into it beyond what was obscured by the snow swirling past his window. During rare moments of relative quiet in the bar, Tom could hear the low howling of the wind. </p>
  <p class = story> He shivered involuntarily, a sudden chill passing over him as if he were <i>outside</i> the window looking into the bar. Indeed, being inside the bar was comforting, because the skin-tight costumes of heroes so rarely offered protection against the elements. </p>
  <p class = story> Repeated pokes to his side suddenly snapped him out of his stupor. Tom turned to his attacker. The man in question was seated next to him at the table and grinning unapologetically. Tom would have in fact summed up the entirety of the manâ€™s existence as unapologetic. His dark curly hair was neatly styled, except for a few loose strands that hung over his forehead despite the fact that they could easily be fixed with a comb. His shirt seemed otherwise pressed and neat, except that a closer inspection revealed a stain along the forearm. He could have hidden it by simply rolling up his sleeves, yet he shamelessly let it be. </p>
