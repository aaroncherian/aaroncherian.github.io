       <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Once again, Tom found himself
       looking out at the window next to him. It was comforting really, to on the
       longest night of the year be able to look out at the quickly accumulating snow
       without actually having to be outside in it. He stared out at the exceedingly
       rapid crawl of snow and ice across the streets. <o:p></o:p></p>

       <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The sky was an endless gray, and
       even though it was well into the night, he found he could easily see into it,
       beyond what was obscured by the snow being pushed past his window. When he
       focused, he heard the low howling of the wind as it drove flecks of white in
       endless circles and loops. <o:p></o:p></p>

       <p class=MsoNormal>He shivered involuntarily as he felt a chill come over him,
       as if he were on the other side of the window looking in. Indeed, it was
       comforting, because the skin-tight costumes of heroes so rarely offered
       protection against the elements.</p>
