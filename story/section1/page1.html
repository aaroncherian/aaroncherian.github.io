        <p class = story> Once again, Tom found himself looking out at the window next to him, staring out at the crawl of snow across streets and sidewalks. The sky was an endless gray, and even though it was well into the night Tom could easily see into it beyond what was obscured by the snow swirling past his window. During rare moments of relative quiet in the bar, Tom could hear the low howling of the wind. </p>
<p class = story> He took a bit of comfort in the fact that he could look out at the accumulating ice without having to actually be on patrol in it. </p>
 <p class = story> A sudden chill caused him to shiver involuntarily, as if the glass pane protecting him from the storm outside had vanished.</p>
<p class = story>Indeed, being inside the bar was comforting, because the skin-tight costumes of heroes so rarely offered protection against the elements. Tom was awoken from his stupor by repeated pokes to his side, by a very irritated man seated next to him at the table. </p>
<p class = story>“Can I help you?” Tom asked, mildly exasperated.</p>
<p class = story> “I’m getting bored and it’s hard to hold a conversation when you keep zoning out,” the man complained.</p>
