  <p class = story> The conversation continued around him, but Tom inexplicably found himself drifting away again, his attention drawn back to the window. He shivered again, and for a moment he thought he could feel the wind and snow against his own face. </p>
  <p class = story> A hand lightly touched his own, bringing him back to the conversation. It was too gentle for Enzo, far too lingering for Ayano, and well, Bryan had other ways of getting his attention if he wanted, which only left Lilah. He looked back, and she was wearing a slight frown. </p>
  <p class = story> “You feel cold,” she said, and then shrugged slightly, speaking more quietly. “Anyway, I’m glad things are working out for you now. I know things were rough for you at the end there with the hero business… and a bit with Dee too.” </p>
  <p class = story> Tom sighed a bit, resisting the urge to reach for and twist his wedding band around his finger. </p>
  <p class = story> “Yeah, rough is kind of an understatement honestly. But things have worked out, I think. Both business-wise and marriage-wise, things between me and Dee are a lot better now. And you know what they say, you don’t become a hero to pay the bills.” </p>
  <p class = story>  Lilah nodded and smiled. </p>
  <p class = story> “I’m glad.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Say, do you miss being a hero?” </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah paused for a moment before answering Tom. </p>
  <p class = story> “Absolutely.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Well, at least you don’t have to deal with the blasted commission system anymore,” Tom said, chuckling a bit. Lilah rolled her eyes, </p>
  	<p class = story> “I can’t believe that system still exists. Honestly, a terrible way to pay heroes.” Tom nodded in agreement. A wave of cold passed over him once again and he looked to the window.
  <p class = story> Lilah followed Tom’s gaze. </p>
  <p class = story>  “You know, the weather was just like this, the last time we were all together,” Lilah mused. The others turned their head now to the window as well. Tom thought back to it, the last time they had all been together, but the memory seemed to slide out of his reach. </p>
  	<p class = story>  “Was it really? I don’t remember that.” Tom said. He frowned then, as he thought on it further, realizing that there were many details that were escaping him. Namely, one very important detail. </p>
