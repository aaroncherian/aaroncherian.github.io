    <p class = story> Tom looked to the door again. Just where was Ayano? He couldn’t help but feel the slightest bit of worry, although he brushed it aside. There wasn’t anything Ayano couldn’t outrun.</p>
    <p class = story> For a few moments there was no conversation between them as they ate. A comfortable silence, slowly filled in by chatter around them. Tom’s attention was drawn to the window again, transfixed by the wailing winds and swirling snow just outside it. </p>
    <p class = story> Enzo elbowed him. </p>
    <p class = story> “You know with this weather reminds me of?” He asked, smiling mischievously. </p>
    <p class = story> Tom shook his head. “What?” </p>
     <p class = story> “Remember that that time the mayor was being held hostage outside city hall?” Enzo asked. </p>
    <p class = story> “Oh, <i>this</i> story again,” Lilah groaned. “Seven years later and he still won’t let you forget it Tom.” </p>
    <p class = story> “Exactly it’s been <i>seven years</i>, I think it’s about time for a dramatic retelling,” Enzo protested. </p>
    <p class = story> “Enzo it was only funny the <i>first time</i>. I think though, that the last time I remember hearing this story was that last night we were all together,” Lilah commented. Her face fell. “Not that it holds the most pleasant memories for any of us.”</p>
