    <p class = story> Tom felt the tell-tale pressure of Bryan’s powers again, and this time the image was of five costumes hanging in the air on vague figures. Their old costumes. Ayano’s was the same brilliant red costume and mask for her eyes that she still wore on patrol. Bryan’s and Lilah’s hung side by side, his a ghostly white long-jacket and full face mask, while hers was a purple suit jacket, black gloves hanging out of one pocket, while the end of a conductors baton was poking out of another. Enzo’s was nothing more than a black hooded shirt with blue accents going across it. Tom felt a pang of nostalgia as he looked at his own, a simple green costume. </p>
<p class = story> Bryan then gestured out to the crowd around them, who were all wearing various costumes of their own. </p>
	<p class = story> “Yeah, it’s weird,” Enzo said. “I’m so used to coming straight after one of our patrol shifts here, still in costume. It doesn’t feel right to be here without one.” Bryan nodded in agreement. </p>
<p class = story> “I agree,” Lilah said. “Right now it feels like the only things that have changed are us.”  </p>
