<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> A moment later a feeling of intense cold struck him, as if Ayano opening the door had unleashed a winter storm within the bar.</p>
<p class = story> Tom blinked once. </p>
<p class = story> The crowd of heroes in the bar disappeared, and with it their conversations, leaving behind an eerie silence that was interrupted by the sound of his own breathing. </p>
<p class = story> He blinked again. </p>
<p class = story> Tom realized he was no longer wearing his costume, but rather the jacket and jeans he had been wearing to meet the others. The bar itself looked a just a bit older, the wood a little darker, the tables a tad dirtier. </p>
<p class = story> He blinked a third time. </p>
<p class = story>  Tom found he could move freely again, his muscles and body responsive to his commands. </p>
<p class = story> A fourth blink. </p>
<p class = story> The chill that was making its way through his body faded, giving way to warmth. Tom looked around, and saw that the bar was populated with heroes once again. The young firestarter that had been showing off his powers earlier was now in conversation with another, older hero. The sudden return of noise and discourse was slightly jarring after the few moments of complete silence he had just experienced. </p>
<p class = story> It felt like almost no time had passed. And yet everything he remembered did very little to answer his original question and all he had to show for his troubles was a slight headache. </p>
