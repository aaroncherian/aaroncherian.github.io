<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Tom followed her gaze to see a woman dressed in a costume blue as ice, streaked with darker blue lines. It almost matched his own in its simplicity. A golden insignia was near her right shoulder, marking her as a captain. Tom’s own insignia was located by his left shoulder. </p>
<p class = story> “Shard,” he greeted her warmly, although he found himself tensing just a bit and glancing to the empty space next to Lilah. </p>
<p class = story> “Evening Tom,” she replied. She noticed the movement. “I’m just here to do a bit of shameless recruitment. Livewire?” </p>
<p class = story> Tom relaxed, and Enzo saluted Shard smartly. </p>
<p class = story> “Yes ma’am captain sir. Livewire here, ready and willing to serve,” he said. </p>
<p class = story> Shard sighed almost imperceptibly before speaking. </p>
<p class = story> “I’ve gotten word that some particular law enforcement agencies have begun an infiltration of the Jailbirds.” </p>
<p class = story> Tom was familiar with the group, a mercenary strike team that specialized in breaking out any criminal with the wealth to afford their particularly extravagant prices from prison. </p>
<p class = story> Enzo nodded, and Shard continued. </p>
<p class = story> “Headquarters has already taken the liberty of letting me know that when the police and whatever other agencies that are involved have gotten with they wanted, we’ll be called in to wipe the Jailbirds out. It’ll take a month or two, but I’m to lead that team and I’m just letting a few of our heavy hitters know well in advance. Can I count on you?” </p>
<p class = story> Enzo nodded, before glancing quickly at Lilah. </p>
<p class = story> “You know in terms of heavy hitters-“</p>
<p class = story> “I’m being particular with the heroes I choose for this one, Livewire. Headquarters wants this one kept close to the chest,” Shard cut in. </p>
<p class = story> “Don’t suppose you’ll need my help?” Ayano asked. Shard looked her way. </p>
