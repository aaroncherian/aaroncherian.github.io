  <p class = story> “The Scarlet Speedstress,” a new voice said. Tom looked over to where a hero in an icy-blue costume had arrived to their table.  </p>
<p class = story> “Shard!” Ayano waved at the hero in return, calling her by her moniker. “And please, we don’t need to use my code name any more than necessary. It’s not really mine to begin with.” </p>
<p class = story> Shard smiled, </p>
<p class = story>  “I had something I wanted to talk to you about, but before all that, how’s your mother doing?” </p>
<p class = story> Ayano’s smile faded for a slight second, before returning again. </p>
<p class = story> “About the same really, sometimes she remembers everything, other times she doesn’t even remember she was a hero once. She can’t use her speed either, let alone remember that she has it,” Ayano said in a quieter voice than was usual. </p>
<p class = story> 	“We all thank her for her service to this city.” Shard murmured. </p>
<p class = story> “She’s not dead!” Ayano snapped suddenly. Shard shook her head in response, </p>
<p class = story>  “No, that’s not what I meant Ayano. A long time ago, back when Tom and I first started on the job, you said those words to every hero when they came back from a job well done. Somehow, over the years, it’s only come to apply to those who never made it back,” she said. “Your mother would be quite proud of you taking up her mantle, and even happier to see how much you’ve accomplished in just the few months that you’ve been on patrol. She would also be happy to know that you were placed under Tom’s supervision. They started out on the same patrol team, years ago.” </p>
<p class = story> Ayano looked down and nodded. </p>
<p class = story> “Family truly does define us,” Shard commented off-handedly, although there was an edge to her voice now. Tom could see Lilah bristle at that, but she remained silent. </p>
<p class = story> “But there’s also one other thing,” Shard added, her tone becoming a touch more business-like. </p>
<p class = story> “My team has been giving me reports lately, of how they’ll often find you responding to calls and getting to the scene before them. Even when you’re off-shift. Ayano, as a captain, I need you to-“ </p>
<p class = story> “I get it,” Ayano cut in, her voice cold. “I’ve heard it before. I respond to calls first, which means some other heroes don’t get to pick up commission because of this barbarically stupid new system. I <i> understand </i>. But what I don’t seem to understand is when everyone started caring more about the money, and forgot about actually <i>helping</i> people.” </p>
<p class = story>Shard’s smile faded. </p>
<p class = story> “Ayano, I don’t want to make this a formal warning but-“ Shard paused, as the lights started to flicker overhead, and Tom looked over at Enzo, who seemed ready to jump into the conversation, his anger on behalf of Ayano written over his face. Tom stared him down and shook his head. The anger clearly remained, but Enzo kept quiet, and the lights returned to normal. </p>
<p class = story> “Just keep it in mind,” Shard said looking to the side, before stepping away from their table. </p>
<p class = story> Shard did pause for a moment, her gaze settling on the purple flame dancing atop their one lit candle. She seemed like she was about to comment, but instead turned and walked away. </p>
