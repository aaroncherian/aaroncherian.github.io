  <p class = story> He noticed Lilah staring at him, a measure of concern on her face. She refrained from saying anything though, waiting until the others were drawn into other conversation. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom felt short jabs to his arm now, and looked over at Lilah, who was poking at his arm with her conductor’s wand in amusement. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Careful will you?” Tom complained, rubbing his arm. “I don’t need you setting me on fire or anything.” If anyone else had made the joke, they might have really found themselves in danger of being burnt to a crisp, but Lilah never seemed bothered when it came from Tom. </p>
  	<p class = story> “If only I actually needed this stick of wood to set you on fire,” Lilah said rolling her eyes. “And if only you hadn’t insisted on our costumes being flame-proof.” She flicked a finger, and the wick of a candle set on their table spontaneously burst into a small purple flame. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom examined her wand for a second and frowned. </p>
  	<p class = story> “This looks suspiciously unburnt. Is it new?” He asked. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Um. No.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “What happened to the old one?!” Tom asked again, leaning forward. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah sighed, before starting. “Okay, so maybe I was in a <i>bit </i> of a tight situation a few days ago. And maybe I was cornered, and nothing flammable happened to be in close proximity. And maybe those crooks had taken my wand thinking that I couldn’t use my powers without it. So maybe-“</p>
  	<p class = story> “Alright, I understand,” Tom said, rubbing his face tiredly. “I thought we agreed before that any situation where the only thing you can burn is that measly stick is a bad one. Why didn’t you call me for back-up?” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Tom, it was a stone alleyway. And you know, there was a lot of snow and ice around,” Lilah said shrugging. Tom clenched his fists, and looked down, his jaw tightening. Lilah observed him, before poking him again. </p>
