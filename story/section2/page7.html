<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> He noticed Lilah staring at him, a measure of concern on her face. She refrained from saying anything however, waiting until the others were drawn again into conversation. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom felt short jabs into his arm and looked over at Lilah, who was poking at him with her conductor’s wand in amusement. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Careful will you?” Tom complained, rubbing his arm. “I don’t need you setting me on fire.” Anyone else making this joke might have very much found themselves in danger of incineration, but Tom was an exception to this rule. </p>
  	<p class = story> “If only I actually needed this stick of wood to set you on fire,” Lilah said rolling her eyes. “And if only you hadn’t insisted on our costumes being flame-proof.” She flicked a finger, and the wick of a candle set on their table burst into a small purple flame. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom caught a glimpse of her wand as she held it out and frowned. </p>
  	<p class = story> “This looks suspiciously shiny. Is it new?”  </p>
  	<p class = story> “Um. No.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “What happened to the old one?!” Tom asked again, leaning forward. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah sighed. “Okay, so maybe I was in a <i>bit </i> of a tight situation a few days ago. And you know those situations where you're cornered and you can't use your powers cause there's nothing flammable nearby, right? Cause I mean we've all been there.”</p>
    <p class = story>
      “You're babbling, which means you're <i>stalling</i>.""
    </p>
      <p class = story>
         “Okay, okay fine. So I let those crooks  take my wand because they thought I couldn’t use my powers without it. And well, then you should have seen their faces when it combusted in front of them.” </p>
<p class = story>
   "Any of them, ah, permanently injured?" Tom asked immediately. Lilah gave him a hard glare and he winced.
</p>
    <p class = story> “Sorry, sorry, I know, not your style. Just required to ask, it's part of the job description.” Tom said, rubbing his face tiredly. “But I thought we agreed before that any situation where the only thing you can burn is that twig is a bad one. Why didn’t you call me for back-up?” </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah looked mildly offended at his calling her polished baton a twig.</p>
    <p class = story> “Tom, it was a stone alleyway. And you know, there was a lot of snow and ice around,” she said shrugging.</p>
<p class = story>
   Tom understood the subtext: <i>Your powers would have been useless. </i>
 </p>
 <p class = story>
     He clenched his fists and looked down, his jaw tightening. Lilah observed him, before poking him again. </p>
