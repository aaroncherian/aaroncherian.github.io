  <p class = story> He noticed Lilah staring at him, a measure of concern on her face. She refrained from saying anything however, waiting until the others were drawn again into conversation. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom felt short jabs into his arm and looked over at Lilah, who was poking at him with her conductor’s wand in amusement. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Careful will you?” Tom complained, rubbing his arm. “I don’t need you setting me on fire.” Had anyone else made the joke, they might have really found themselves in danger of incineration, but Lilah never seemed bothered when it came from Tom. </p>
  	<p class = story> “If only I actually needed this stick of wood to set you on fire,” Lilah said rolling her eyes. “And if only you hadn’t insisted on our costumes being flame-proof.” She flicked a finger, and the wick of a candle set on their table burst into a small purple flame. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom examined her wand for a second and frowned. </p>
  	<p class = story> “This looks suspiciously shiny. Is it new?” He asked. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Um. No.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “What happened to the old one?!” Tom asked again, leaning forward. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah sighed. “Okay, so maybe I was in a <i>bit </i> of a tight situation a few days ago. And maybe I was cornered and there was nothing flammable in close proximity. And maybe I had let those crooks had take my wand because they thought I couldn’t use my powers without it. So maybe-”</p>
  	<p class = story> “<i>Alright</i>, I understand,” Tom said, rubbing his face tiredly. “I thought we agreed before that any situation where the only thing you can burn is that stick is a bad one. Why didn’t you call me for back-up?” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Tom, it was a stone alleyway. And you know, there was a lot of snow and ice around,” Lilah said shrugging. Tom clenched his fists, and looked down, his jaw tightening. Lilah observed him, before poking him again. </p>
