		<h2> Priya </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> It was far too sunny a day to be standing in a cemetery, Priya thought to herself as she stood among the gravestones, the sun shining down on her. She looked down at the grave directly in front of her. </p>
<p class = story> <i> Kiran. A somewhat adequate husband. A friend to many. Good riddance. </i> </p>
	<p class = story>  She laughed to herself softly. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Write something interesting on my grave</i>, he had always said, <i>so that when people pass by they’ll have to stop and stare for a moment</i>. </p>
	<p class = story> Well she had. They had talked about what they wanted their gravestones to say perhaps just a touch more than a normal married couple, but such was the life of being a hero. But that wasn’t something to mention on a grave in a public cemetery. There was a different memorial for him elsewhere, one that honored the hero he was, one that memorialized him and his sacrifice the day the city burned. </p>
<p class = story> And she also knew that on the wall, right outside the Charred Streets, a small insignia was transcribed next to where his name was written, among all the names of the others who died that day. It was insignificant to any civilian, but it marked to any veteran hero that visited the wall that the person whose name it sat beside not just an ordinary civilian, but someone who was so much more. </p>
<p class = story> Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She checked the number, confirmed that no one else was in the immediate vicinity, accepted the call and held it to her ear. </p>
<p class = story> “Go for Shard,” she said. </p>
<p class = story> “It’s Tom. The Scarlet Speedstress. She’s-she’s gone,” the man on the other line said in a tired voice. Priya stood there for a few moments, shocked. Impossible. They had always joked that Chihiro was the invincible one, the hero that couldn’t be touched.</p>
<p class = story> “Dead?” Was the only thing she could think to ask at that moment. </p>
 “Ah, sorry, I shook my head there, but you couldn’t have known that,” Tom responded after a few moments of silence, his voice breaking in the middle of his sentence. “She’s not dead, but the person that we knew is gone. Wiped away.” </p>
	<p class = story> “What happened? No, never mind it’s not important. What can I do from here?” Priya asked. Tom sounded distraught, understandably. She would grieve later, but he needed her help now. </p>
	<p class = story> “Her family. They need to know. She has a daughter,” he said slowly. Priya nodded. </p>
	<p class = story> “I’ll do that. What about damage repair there? Any casualties?” </p>
	<p class = story> “Just one other, not on our side. A shapeshifter of sorts, absorbed materials around her. Absorbed concrete before a fight, died because of- Never mind. But you know it’s not like they shift back or anything, so we have a 200-something pound body that needs moving,” he said.</p>
	<p class = story> “Don’t worry Tom, I can take care of it. I’ll call insurance, headquarters, all the usual suspects. And I’ll meet you tonight and you can fill me in on what happened,” Priya responded.
	“There’s one other thing,” Tom said, so softly she almost missed it. </p>
	<p class = story>  <p class = story> “What’s that?” </p>
	“I want Sensory gone. She’s no hero anymore.”</p>
<p class = story>  Priya frowned. Sensory was a fairly new hero and more importantly, had telepathy, an extremely rare power among the general population, moreso among heroes. But why would she be involved- </p>
<p class = story> <i> Oh. </i> </p>
	<p class = story> “What did she do?” Priya asked, even though she knew what the basic answer would be. </p>
	<p class = story> “She was stressed, fighting the shapeshifter” Tom said, and his voice grew stronger. “Began to lose it, her powers began to lash out against everyone here. And you know how she operates, tears a person’s mind apart, leaving them susceptible to her suggestions. Sensory told her opponent to die, and you might guess how the rest went.” </p>
	<p class = story> “We always told her she would push herself too far if she did that,” Priya said, her voice tightening. </p>
	<p class = story> “She did. And then lost control completely. And you know Scarlet, the first to help anyone in trouble. The first to even get to anyone in trouble. Sensory must have used the entirety of her powers on her, even I could feel the effects of the blast in my mind. There’s nothing left of the Scarlet Speedstress anymore. Her mind’s broken, her memory’s gone. And I couldn’t stop it from happening.” Tom’s voice rose in the last few sentences. </p>
	<p class = story> “Tom-“ </p>
	<p class = story> “I want her out, Shard. I want her forgotten. I don’t want anyone to ever remember the hero Sensory <i>existed</i>.”</p>
	<p class = story> “We can’t afford to lose anymore heroes, Tom,” Priya said. “Our city can’t afford it. Some heroes have already applied for transfers elsewhere from rumors about this new commission system. And the Scarlet Speedstress counted for at least ten good heroes in herself.” </p>
<p class = story>  “Sensory’s useless now anyway, burned out her power right then and there. Maybe a quarter as strong as she used to be,” Tom said, his voice quiet once again. They were both silent for a few moments. </p>
<p class = story> “What about Sanctum?” Priya asked. “Sensory was always good with suggestions, but he was always stronger than her when it came to sifting through people’s minds. Can’t he…” She paused, looking for the right word to say. </p>
<p class = story> “Fix her?” Tom said harshly, before exhaling. “He tried, but its beyond his ability to piece it together right now. The damage she did, not even he can fix it at the strength that he’s at.” </p>
<p class = story> “Shard, what do we do now?” He asked a moment later. </p>
<p class = story> “<i>You</i> go back to the bar, I’ll take care of business here first. But after that, Tom, I don’t know. I don’t know at all.” </p>
