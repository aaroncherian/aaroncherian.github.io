		<h2> Priya </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> It was far too sunny a day to be standing in a cemetery, Priya thought as she stood among the gravestones. She looked down at the grave directly in front of her. </p>
<p class = story> <i> Kiran. A husband. A friend. Good riddance. </i> </p>
<p class = story>  She laughed to herself softly.
<p class = story>  <i>Write something interesting on my grave</i>, he had always said, <i>so that when people pass by they’ll have to stop and stare for a moment.</i> </p>
<p class = story>  It was cruel on his part to expect that of her. Kiran had always been the one with a sense of humor, not her.  </p>
<p class = story> They had talked about what they wanted to engrave on their tombstones perhaps just a touch more than a normal married couple, but such was the life of being heroes. But Kiran's job wasn’t a fact to mention on a grave in a public cemetery. They had a different memorial for heroes elsewhere, and there he was honored as the hero Umbra, remembered for his sacrifice the day the city burned. </p>
<p class = story> His civilian name was also transcribed on a third memorial, the large marble wall that towered over the Scorched Streets, along with the names of all the others who died that day. </p>
<p class = story>  Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Not her civilian phone, but her other one. She checked the incoming number, confirming there was no one else in the immediate vicinity before answering. </p>
<p class = story>  “Go for Shard,” she said. </p>
<p class = story> “It’s Grove. The Scarlet Speedstress. She’s... gone,” the man on the other line said. His voice sounded weary.</p>
<p class = story> Priya stood there, shocked. </p>
<p class = story> It should have been impossible. They had always joked that Chihiro was the invincible one, the hero that couldn’t be touched. </p>
<p class = story>  “Dead?” It was the only thing she could think to ask. There were a few moments of silence. </p>
<p class = story>  “Ah, sorry, I shook my head there, but you couldn’t have known that,” Tom responded, his voice breaking in the middle of his sentence. “She’s not dead, but the person that we knew is gone. Wiped away.” </p>
<p class = story>  “What happened? No, never mind it’s not important. What can I do from here, Grove?” Priya asked. Tom sounded distraught, and understandably so. She could grieve later, but he needed her help now. </p>
<p class = story> “Her family. They need to know. She has a daughter,” Tom said slowly. Priya nodded. </p>
<p class = story>  “I’ll do that. What about damage repair there? Any casualties?” </p>
<p class = story>  “Just one other, not on our side. A shapeshifter class, assimilated materials around her into her skin. Absorbed concrete before a fight and… well she’s dead now. But you know shapeshifters don't shift back or anything after death, so we have a 400-something pound body that needs moving,” he said. </p>
<p class = story>  “Don’t worry Tom, I can take care of it. I’ll call insurance, Headquarters, all the usual suspects. Then I’ll meet you tonight and you can fill me in on what happened,” Priya responded. </p>
<p class = story> Tom said something so softly that Priya missed it. </p>
<p class = story> “What’s that?” </p>
<p class = story> “I want Sensory gone. She’s no hero anymore.” He said, louder this time. </p>
<p class = story>  Priya frowned. Sensory was a fairly new hero to the city and more importantly had telepathy, an extremely rare power among the general population, more so among heroes. But why would she be involved-</p>
<p class = story> <i>Oh.</i> </p>
<p class = story> “What did she do?” Priya asked, even though she knew what the basic answer would be. </p>
<p class = story> “She was fighting the shapeshifter, and losing too. She was stressed, under pressure,” Tom said, and his voice grew stronger. “And then she began to lose it. Her powers began to lash out against everyone. And you know how she operates, she tears a person’s mind apart, leaving them susceptible to her suggestions. Sensory suggested to the shapeshifter that she die, and well you can guess how the rest went. But then Sensory lost control.” </p>
<p class = story>  “She would pushed herself too far,” Priya said, her voice tightening. </p>
<p class = story>  “We did. And then she lost control completely. And you know the Scarlet Speedstress, the first to help anyone in trouble. The first to get to anyone in trouble. She got too close. Sensory panicked and struck out. She must have used the entirety of her powers on Chihiro, even I could feel the effects of the blast in my mind. There’s nothing left of the Scarlet Speedstress anymore. Her mind’s broken, her memory’s gone. <i>And I couldn’t stop it from happening.</i>” Tom’s voice rose in the last few sentences. </p>
<p class = story>
   It was against protocols to use their real names during a conversation, but Priya let it slide.
</p>
<p class = story> “Tom-" She started </p>
<p class = story>  “I want her out, Shard. I want her forgotten. I don’t want anyone to ever remember the hero Sensory <i>existed.</i>”</p>
<p class = story>  “We can’t afford to lose anymore heroes, Tom,” Priya said. “Our city can’t afford it. Some heroes have already applied for transfers elsewhere from rumors about this new commission system. And the Scarlet Speedstress counted for at least ten good heroes in herself.” </p>
<p class = story> Priya paused after a moment, and the grief and anger she had been repressing surfaced. </p>
<p class = story> Why was she defending Sensory? What right did she have to remain a hero when the Scarlet Speedstress couldn’t? </p>
<p class = story> “No, you’re right Grove. She deserves to be forgotten,” she said, her voice betraying her emotions. </p>

<p class = story>  “Sensory is useless now anyway, burned out her power right. Maybe a quarter as strong as she used to be,” Tom said, his voice quiet once again. They were both silent for a few moments. </p>
<p class = story>  “What about Sanctum?” Priya asked. “Sensory was always good with suggestions, but he was always stronger than her when it came to sifting through people’s minds. Can’t he…” She paused, looking for the right word to say. </p>
<p class = story>  “Fix her?” Tom asked harshly. He took a moment, and Priya could hear him audibly exhale before continuing. “He tried, but its beyond his ability to piece it together. The damage she did, not even he's strong enough to fix it.” </p>
<p class = story>  “Shard, what do we do now?” He asked a moment later. </p>
<p class = story> “<i>You</i> go back to the bar, I’ll take care of business here first. But after that, Grove, I don’t know. We'll just do what's necessary and continue on. We always do.” </p>
