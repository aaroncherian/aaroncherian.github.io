  <p class = story>  “You should be shutting down communication to Headquarters when you’re off-shift, its standard protocol now,” Tom reminded her, trying to keeping his voice calm. </p>
  <p class = story> Ayano shifted uncomfortably in her seat, </p>
  <p class = story> “A witness called in a mugging close by. It was simple job to do, and I knew I could get there before any other heroes could, and before anyone else got hurt. That’s all there is to it,” she said. </p>
  <p class = story> “Ayano, I’ve told you already. When your shift is done, it’s not your job to take any calls. Leave it to the other heroes on patrol,” Tom replied, taking in a deep breath, tremors shaking his voice slightly as anger slipped through.  </p>
  	<p class = story> “Actually, Tom I think it is my job to help someone that calls for help. I didn’t become a hero to ignore calls because my hours are up,” Ayano responded, clearly not budging on the topic. </p>
  	<p class = story> The anger was harder to keep down now, and Tom felt it filling up his thoughts. </p>
  <p class = story> It just wasn’t as <i> simple </i> as helping people on a whim, not anymore. There were rules in place. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom clenched his fists, a response forming in his mind, saturated with his rising frustration and anger, but he felt a familiar presence pressing down on his mind. </p>
