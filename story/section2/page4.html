  <p class = story>  “You should be shutting down communication to Headquarters when you’re off-shift, its standard protocol now,” Tom reminded her, straining to keep his voice calm. </p>
  <p class = story> Ayano shifted uncomfortably in her seat, </p>
  <p class = story> “A witness called in a mugging close by. It was simple job to do, and I knew I could get there before anyone else got hurt. That’s all there is to it,” she said. </p>
  <p class = story> “And before any other heroes who could have done the job just as well. Ayano, I’ve told you already. When your shift is done, don't take any more calls. Leave it to the others on patrol,” Tom replied, taking in a deep breath, tremors shaking his voice slightly as anger slipped through.  </p>
  	<p class = story> “Actually, Tom I think it is my job to help someone that calls for it. I didn’t become a hero to ignore calls because my hours are up,” Ayano argued. The determined expression on her face indicated that she wasn't planning to budge on the subject. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom felt the anger in the back of his mind slowly growing. Her mindset was admirable, but not practical. </p>
  <p class = story> Because it wasn’t as <i> simple </i> as helping people on a whim, not anymore.</p>
  <p class = story> Because there were new rules, and Ayano made it worse for everyone when she ignored them. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom clenched his fists, formulating a sharp rebuke until a small calmness washed over him. Not enough to smother the anger completely, but enough to make him pause.</p>
