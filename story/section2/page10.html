  <p class = story> “The Scarlet Speedstress,” she said, smiling. “I’m afraid you’ll need a little more field experience before I can bring you in.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Understood,” Ayano said. “And please, just call me Ayano. I still feel like the name Scarlet Speedstress belongs to my mother.” </p>
  <p class = story> “I…I haven’t had the chance to check on her lately,” Shard commented, her voice a bit softer. “Has she been doing any better?”</p>
  <p class = story> Ayano’s smile faded.</p>
  <p class = story> “About the same really. Sometimes she remembers a few details, other times she doesn’t even remember she was a hero once. She can’t use her speed either. Well actually, she doesn't even recall she has it.” Ayano said in a more subdued tone. </p>
  <p class = story> <a href = "priya.html"> “We all thank Chihiro for her service to this city.” Shard murmured. </a> </p>
  <p class = story> Ayano looked down.</p>
  <p class = story> “That’s what we say for the ones that died,” she said.</p>
  <p class = story> A contemplative expression crossed Shard’s face. Enzo reached out and lightly punched Ayano on the shoulder. She looked up at him and her smile returned, if slightly diminished.</p>
  <p class = story> “I would tend to disagree. I believe it’s more to honor any hero that’s accomplished their duties to this city, made it a safer place to live,” Shard responded. “And the Scarlet Speedstress now lives through you. Chihiro would be proud to see what you’ve become in the few months you’ve been on patrol, and happy knowing that you’re serving under an old teammate of hers as well.</p>
  <p class = story> “Family, in a way, does truly define us,” she added off-handedly. Lilah bristled at the comment, but said nothing. Shard began to walk away, but turned back to look at Ayano again, her expression softening. Tom frowned, just slightly.</p>
  <p class = story> “As another tip, Ayano,” she said, and her tone was a touch more business-like. “I’ve been receiving a few…complaints from a few heroes under me. About how they’ve seen you at crime scenes, even after responding to calls. I understand you want to help but-”</p>
  <p class = story> “<i>No</i>,” Ayano cut in, her voice cold. The surprise on Shard’s face mirrored that of everyone at the table. “I’ve heard it before. I respond to calls and get to the bad guys first, which means some other heroes don’t get to pick up commission because of this new and barbarically stupid system. But I accepted this job, left my other life entirely, to become the Scarlet Speedstress to honor her memory. And she wouldn’t let herself be restricted either.” </p>
  <p class = story> “But even she understood that the rules were there for a reason,” Shard said and then paused as the lights overhead flickered for just a moment. Tom looked over at Enzo, who seemed to be oblivious to the electrical activity, his gaze resting upon Shard. Tom jabbed slightly into his side and he glanced up, before taking a deep breath and sitting back. Tom raised an eyebrow at Shard, who looked to the side.</p>
  <p class = story> “Just keep it in mind,” she said, stepping away from the table. She paused for a moment, her gaze settling on the singular purple flame dancing atop the candle on their table before walking away. </p>
