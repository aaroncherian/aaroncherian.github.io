  <p class = story> A moment later a feeling of intense cold struck him, as if Ayano opening the door had unleashed a winter storm within the bar. </p>
  	<p class = story>Tom blinked and the crowd of heroes in the bar disappeared and with it their conversations. An eerie silence descended on the bar, interrupted only by the sound of Tomâ€™s own breathing.</p>
  	<p class = story> He blinked again and his clothes changed from his costume to the civilian ones he had been wearing to meet the others. The bar itself looked a just a bit older, the wood a little darker, the tables a little dirtier. </p>
  	<p class = story> A third time, and he found himself able to move freely again.</p>
  	<p class = story> He blinked a fourth time and everything returned to normal. The chill that was making his way through his body gave way to the warmth of being inside the bar. The sudden return of noise was slightly jarring after those few moments of complete silence. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom looked around and saw that the bar was populated with heroes once again. He could see the young man showing off his powers earlier in conversation with another older hero. It appeared that almost no time at all had passed. And yet for all the strangeness he had just experienced, it seemed he had actually learned very little to answer his original question. </p>
  	<p class = story> In fact, the only thing it had really done was leave him with a slight headache. </p>
