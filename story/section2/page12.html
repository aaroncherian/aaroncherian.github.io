  <p class = story> The bar seemed to suddenly fall away around Tom. Walls and windows darkened into an ash-like color as they crumbled down around him, leaving him at the mercy of the storm outside. Tom shut his eyes briefly as cold wet snow whipped against his face.  </p>

    A moment later, the wind subsided, and when Tom opened his eyes, he found himself at the bar table again. He realized he could move freely, and he examined his reflection in the window pane, an older somber man that started back impassively at him. As far as Tom could tell, the bizarre experience had ended and he was situated in the present. He had never physically lived through his memory in such a way before, and found himself troubled by how realistic it had been. And it seemed that for all he had seen, it had left his original questioned unanswered and given him the joyous gift of slight headache.
