  <p class = story> “Listen, Tom. I get it, plant powers don't mix well in winter. And with this new, absurd commission-based salary system we have to live with, catching criminals and collecting commission is pretty hard. I get it, things are rough right? Probably a little with Dee too?” She asked. Tom looked up at surprise at her, before smiling slightly, as he twisted his wedding band around his finger. Of course, typical Lilah, getting straight to the heart of the problems. </p>
  	<p class = story> There was a brief lull in their conversation as Bryan left the table, using one of his many established gestures to signal he was going to the bathroom. </p>
  	<p class = story> “You know how it goes, you don’t become a hero to pay the bills. Things were doable before for me and Dee, but it’s a lot rougher now. Things haven’t exactly been, well the most cordial between us lately.” Tom said. Lilah nodded sympathetically, thinking for a moment, before speaking again. </p>
  	<p class = story> “You could always look into the private sector. Get out of the government-sponsored patrols and the commission system,” she said. They both laughed a bit, it was a joke that had been repeated many a time over the recent months. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Really, let me know if you find an opening for someone that’s not a twenty-something hero fresh out of training.” Tom sighed and sat back. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Please, I’d take that spot myself. They care a lot less about your past in the private sector than they do here. ” Lilah said. She paused for a few moments, and suddenly sat forward. </p>
  <p class = story> “Tell you what, Tom. There’s a newly formed patrol group that’s a bit understaffed right now, and they’d appreciate a little help. It’ll be a few extra patrol shifts, but it’ll be me and you. I can help you melt out the snow, you can use your powers a bit more freely. Maybe it’ll help, at least until spring comes around.” </p>
  <p class = story>Tom thought about it, and nodded slowly. </p>
  <p class = story> “Thank you. Really,” he said gratefully. Lilah smiled and nodded in response. She looked to the side, and the smile quickly dropped from her face.  </p>
