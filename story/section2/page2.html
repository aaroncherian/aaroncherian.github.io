  <p class = story>  “-and then Tom’s like, ‘I can take care of this, no problem.’” Enzo continued on.  “So he puts his hand down on the ground, and we’re all waiting for plant mayhem to break lose right? And then we realize that all that snow froze overnight and there’s this sheet of ice that’s blocking any of those crazy plants and vines of his from breaking through. And the mayor, oh man she just gives Tom this look that’s says-“ </p>
  	<p class = story>  “<i>Really</i>, Enzo, we don’t have to go through this again,” Tom cut in in exasperation. “That’s the fourth time I’m fairly certain.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Fifth actually,” Enzo stated. “But it’s just so damn fun to talk about how useless you are during winter.” </p>
  	<p class = story>  He was only joking, but Tom felt frustrated all the same. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I am <i> not </i> useless during winter!” Tom snapped. </p>
  <p class = story> “Alright Lorenzo, he’s getting snippy. Give him a little break.” Lilah said. </p>
  <p class = story> Enzo looked at Tom curiously, and the lamp above them dimmed for just the briefest of seconds, but any further conversation was cut off by the arrival of a woman wearing a full crimson costume to their table, brushing snow off her shoulder. </p>
  <p class = story> “Sorry about disappearing on you like that Bryan,” Ayano said responding to what Tom assumed had been a mental question from Bryan. “I just got one more call while we were heading back.” She took off her mask and slid into the seat next to Bryan. </p>
