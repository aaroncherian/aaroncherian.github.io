  <p class = story>  “Don’t read my mind!” He barked suddenly. </p>
<p class = story>  The rest of the table looked up in surprise at his outburst. Even though his face was protected by a mask, the way Bryan jerked back slightly and clenched his fists signalled to Tom that he was hurt by the accusation. And mentally, Tom could feel a sense of pain and panic from Bryan’s mind that disappeared suddenly as Bryan cut off their mental connection. </p>
<p class = story> Tom realized he had likely jumped to conclusions. Bryan was as adept at reading faces as he was reading minds.  </p>
<p class = story> “Sorry,” he apologized sheepishly. “That was way out of line, I’ve just been on edge recently.” </p>
<p class = story>  Never one to hold a grudge, Bryan shrugged and seemed to relax again, although Tom knew though that he would likely be doubling down on keeping his abilities in check throughout the night. The wave of anger inside him receded and gave way to guilt, but still tinged with panic at the chance that Bryan had picked up on some of his thoughts.  </p>
