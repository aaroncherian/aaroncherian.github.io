<p class = story>  The rest of the table looked up in surprise at his outburst. Tom felt slightly light-headed for a moment as Bryan quickly cut their mental connection. Even though Bryan's mask concealed his face, Tom could tell by the way he jerked back slightly and clenched his fists that he was hurt by the accusation. </p>
<p class = story> But it was the emotion that Tom felt from Bryan before he cut their link, confusion and panic, that told him he had been wrong. Bryan was as adept at reading faces as he was reading minds.  </p>
<p class = story> “Oh man, sorry Bryan,” he apologized. “That was way out of line, I’ve just been on edge recently.” </p>
<p class = story>  Never one to hold a grudge, Bryan shrugged and seemed to relax again, although Tom knew though that Bryan would likely double down on keeping his abilities in check for the rest of the night.  </p>
