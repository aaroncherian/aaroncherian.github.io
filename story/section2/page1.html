<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> It was, the least to say, a curious situation. Everything around him seemed so vividly real, even though he was acutely aware that none of it existed. And yet, why was it then that he could feel the cool wood of the table as his fingers brushed against them? And what memory would bring back the scent of all the food in the bar so clearly? </p>
  <p class = story> Tom wished he could look into the window next to him and take a glance at his reflection, but found his body unresponsive. That much made sense, considering it was just a memory. If he hadnâ€™t turned to look at his reflection seven years ago, he wouldn't be able to change that now. Tom relaxed, and immersed himself in the moment. A simple memory, nothing that could harm him. That didn't change the fact of how utterly <i> weird</i> and alien it was to physically live through his memory. </p>
  	<p class = story> Some memories came back to him then. Details like the fact that outside, he knew another winter storm was picking up. </p>
  <p class = story> He also remembered much to his chagrin that he was the topic of the conversation around him. </p>
