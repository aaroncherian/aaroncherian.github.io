<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> This was not normal. </p>
  <p class = story> Everything around him seemed so vividly real, even though he was acutely aware that none of it existed. How could it? It was just a memory. </p>
  <p class = story> And yet he was certain he could feel the cool wood of the table against his fingers. He was certain that he was in fact not imagining the scent of all the food in the bar.</p>
<p class = story> Nevertheless, it was an odd and exceedingly uncomfortable situation. Some part of his mind, the part that he had retired along with his costume years ago, immediately began to examine possible causes and dangers. A mental attack? Someone trapping him within his own mind? He dismissed that idea quickly. Telepathic abilities were extremely rare, and beyond that his own telepath was sitting a mere few feet next to him. Bryan should have immediately noticed if something was wrong.</p>
    <p class = story> But then, curiously, Tom began to remember small slivers of recollections about that night. He remembered now the storm that Lilah had mentioned, the wind and winter weather that was picking up right outside. </p>
  <p class = story> In his mind, he could imagine Enzo giving him advice on this situation, advising him to force his way out of the memory. Lilah was also there, advising him to look for inconsistencies in the illusion. Cracks, that if he applied enough pressure, would break completely. And yet Tom promptly decided to ignore both of them and go with the third option. He mentally immersed himself in the memory, content to see where it would take him and what he would remember from it. </p>
  <p class = story>  And it was that moment he remembered, much to his chagrin, that he was the topic of the conversation around him. </p>
