<p class = story>  The rest of the table looked up in surprise at his outburst. Even though Bryan’s mask covered his face, Tom could tell by the way he jerked back slightly and clenched his fists that he was hurt by the accusation. And mentally, he could feel a sense of pain and guilt from Bryan’s mind, still connected to his, before disappearing suddenly as Bryan withdrew his connection. </p>

<p class = story> “Sorry,” he apologized sheepishly. “That was way out of line, I’ve just been on edge recently.” </p>

The wave of anger inside him receded and gave way to guilt, but tinged with panic by the thought that Bryan could have picked up on some of his thoughts.  </p>
