  <p class = story> The sense of Bryan making mental contact with him was an intangible feeling that Tom would never be fully able to describe, but it was like someone was pushing ever so slightly against his head. He glanced over at Bryan, who looked down pointedly at the space in front of Tom in return. </p>
	<p class = story> Tom followed his gaze and saw the image of inky black letters coming together on the table. It was Bryan’s way of communicating something too abstract for images. Horribly inefficient for use in the field, they all agreed, but it worked well enough for more idle settings. The letters, of course, were written in a perfect Comic Sans font. Tom didn't quite understand why, but Bryan had spent days meticulously memorizing and perfecting every curve and letter to imitate the font, although both Ayano and Enzo found it uproariously funny. </p>
<p class = story>  “<i>Just relax, Tom. Give her some time. She’ll learn. </i>” They read. </p>
<p class = story> Tom felt numb for just a moment, and then the panic hit him. Had Bryan just read his mind?  </p>
<p class = story>
  His pent-up anger suddenly diverted itself towards a new target.
