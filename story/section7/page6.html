  <p class = story> Tom blinked, and when he opened his eyes, he was in costume, and the bar was alive again. </p>
		<p class = story> Enzo was still the only occupant of the table. </p>
		<p class = story> “When are we?” Tom asked. </p>
	<p class = story> “About a year from the time Ayano died. A few months after Bryan died. And Lilah, well she went off the grid for a bit. Neither of us had seen or heard from her since Bryan’s death. She’ll be here soon enough.” Enzo responded. </p>
	<p class = story>	A thought occurred to Tom. </p>
		<p class = story> “Enzo, I never asked. What happened to you- the real you?” </p>
    	<p class = story> Enzo only had time to give Tom a sad smile before the door opened. </p>
