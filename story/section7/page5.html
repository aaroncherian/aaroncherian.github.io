  <p class = story> “It’s the last one, Tom. After that, everything should become clear. Speaking of which…” Enzo’s voice trailed off as he looked pointedly at the walls of the bar, which had slowly begun to repair themselves from the base up. Unseen strings started to pull the furniture back into place. Mounds of snow were thrown out of the bar, and shattered windows began to reconstitute themselves, piece by piece. </p>
  <p class = story> “It’s coming,” Tom said. He looked up at Enzo, and saw sadness written on the man’s face. </p>
  <p class = story> <i>He thinks it’s just the end of one cycle, before another one starts all over again</i>, Tom realized. </p>
  <p class = story> Suddenly, he reached out and clasped an arm around the man’s wrist. </p>
  <p class = story> “Not this time,” Tom said. “That’s what you’re afraid of right? That when all of this is done, I’ll forget again, and leave you alone here?” </p>
  <p class = story> Enzo’s expression shifted. </p>
  <p class = story> “It gets so lonely here,” Enzo whispered, looking down. “Locked away in some corner of your mind.” </p>
  <p class = story> “Not anymore,” Tom declared. “I won’t let it knock me down, not this time. <i>This time</i>, I already know part of the truth going in. I won’t let this control me any longer.” </p>
  <p class = story> Enzo looked up. He smiled, a small genuine one. The image of Enzo flickered away, and was replaced by one of Tom himself. Tom held onto the arm of a man that looked exactly like him, but much older. Dark circles framed his eyes, he was a bit thinner, and seemed just a bit frailer. Fragile, tired. </p>
  <p class = story> “Thank you,” the apparition said softly. A moment later, Enzo flickered back into being. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom smiled. </p>
  <p class = story> “Take me to the next memory,” he said. Enzo looked at him for a long moment before nodding. </p>
