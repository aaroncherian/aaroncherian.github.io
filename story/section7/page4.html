  <p class = story> “No time to dwell,” Tom said curtly. “Bryan? Where is he now?”</p>
 <p class = story> “Buried underneath some non-descript grave.”</p>
 <p class = story> Silence ensued. </p>
 <p class = story> “Buried?” Tom repeated quietly.</p>
 <p class = story> “What else would you expect? He knocked out an entire room full of heroes, just using his mind,” Enzo said. “The entire population of heroes- the entire city- turned against him, all encouraged by none other than yourself. You worked hard, directing people to track him down, training them to clear their minds so Bryan couldn’t read them as easily. In the end, he surrendered. Walked right out into plain sight and held up his hands. No one, at that point, wanted to take a mind-reading, mind-controlling, panic-inducing telepath in alive. </p>
 <p class = story> “And then there’s Lilah. Well, you’ve seen the burn marks, haven’t you?” Enzo continued. “You’ve already guessed at how the bar came to be this way.” </p>
 <p class = story> “She would never,” Tom whispered, even as his gaze settled on charred furniture and blackened portions of the floor and wall. </p>
 <p class = story> “<i>She did</i>,” Enzo suddenly growled. </p>
 <p class = story> “Why?” </p>
 <p class = story> Enzo remained silent. </p>
 <p class = story> Tom sighed. </p>
 <p class = story> “It’s in the next memory, isn’t it? You can’t tell me.” </p>
 <p class = story> Enzo nodded. </p>
