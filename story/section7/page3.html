<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story>	Tom allowed his gaze to sweep across the bar. It was a markedly different bar than what he had seen in his memories. Physically, it was in a state of ruin and disrepair. Tables and chairs seemed to be halfheartedly pushed up against the walls, as if someone had given up during the process. He could see cracked glassware by the bar, covered now with layers of dust. </p>
	<p class = story> And Tom felt a strange nothingness in the room, as if someone had taken a vacuum and sucked out the hearty atmosphere that it had once had, leaving a cold and empty void behind. </p>
	<p class = story> He avoided looking at the burn marks that covered the walls and floor. </p>
  <p class = story>	“So… have I just been sitting here and talking to myself?” Tom asked. </p>
<p class = story>	Enzo nodded. </p>
	<p class = story> “Like an absolute madman,” he added. </p>
	<p class = story> “<i>Unhelpful,</i>” Tom retorted. “So how long has this been happening to me?” </p>
<p class = story>	“A few years now,” Enzo answered. “Started around the time Dee left you-well, us-whatever.” </p>
<p class = story> Tom immediately looked down for his ring, but the only reminder that it had even existed was a barely distinguishable tan line on his finger. </p>
<p class = story> “Is it really any wonder she left?” Enzo asked. “We did have a tendency to put her last on our list of priorities, after all.” </p>
<p class = story> “I-” Tom started, but then stopped. “Strangely, I don’t feel that surprised. I guess maybe even back then I knew that we wouldn’t last.” </p>
<p class = story> Enzo shrugged noncommittally. </p>
