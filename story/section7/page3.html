<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> “It’s been happening on and off for a few years, Tom. You come here and live through it all again. Then you leave, thinking that you’ll never end up here again. But eventually you always do. You always come back, forgetting about all the other times. It’s been happening more frequently recently. As for why it happens, I’m not allowed to tell you.” </p>
<p class =story> It was hard to say what emotions Tom was feeling at that moment, but shock was among them, as he realized that he had likely been shouting and talking like a madman for the past hour or so, all by himself in an abandoned building. And even worse, it wasn’t the first time he had done such a thing. </p>
<p class = story> “Dee would never-” Tom started, but Enzo cut him off. </p>
<p class = story> “She left you, Tom. Around the time you started coming back here.” </p>
<p class = story> Tom reached for his ring, but the only reminder that it had even existed was a barely distinguishable tan line on his finger. </p>
<p class = story> “I need to remember, Enzo. What happened? To Bryan? Lilah? You?”</p>
<p class = story> “Oh well Bryan’s easy enough to explain. He essentially attacked and knocked out, an entire room of heroes. And pretty damn easily too. You convinced everyone that he was a threat, and they all believed you. It became a manhunt, a game of cat-and-mouse, trying to find a man who always knew you were coming,” Enzo said. “You worked hard, directing people to track him down, training them to clear their minds so Bryan couldn’t read them as easily. You didn’t even work that hard to find Ayano’s killer.” There was a bit of reproach in his voice. </p>
<p class = story> When Tom said nothing, Enzo shrugged and continued on, a stray spark arcing off his hand. </p>
<p class = story> “Well long story short, the heroes caught the villain. Tracked him down and launched a large scale ambush one day. Caught him. Killed him. The end.” </p>
<p class = story> Tom expected to feel regret or sadness of sorts, but there was only numbness.</p>
<p class = story> “And I’m dead,” Enzo continued. “Which sucks for me, I suppose. And Lilah. She came for us, you know. It’s the reason the bar is like this. That’s the last memory, Tom. The last roadblock. And maybe after that you can break free. And if not, then next time. Next time, we’ll do it.” </p>
