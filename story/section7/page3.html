  <p class = story> “No!” Tom snapped suddenly. “I can’t remember- I don’t want to.” Enzo smiled sadly, </p>
<p class = story> “Sorry, Tom, you don’t really get a choice in the matter. It’s the only way you’ll break free.” Enzo said. A small blue spark arced along the air from his hand to Tom’s, who flinched in expectation of the pain. There was none. When he opened his eyes, he was in costume, and the bar was alive again. He felt a vague pressure from something tucked into the back of his costume as he leaned back on it. Enzo sat across from him. </p>
<p class = story> “When are we?” Tom asked. </p>
<p class = story> “About a year from the time Ayano died. A few months after Bryan died. And Lilah, well she went off the grid for a bit. Neither of us had seen or heard from since Bryan’s death. She’ll be here soon enough though.” Enzo responded. </p>
<p class = story> “What were we talking about? At this moment, I mean?” Tom questioned him, looking around. </p>
<p class = story> “Doesn’t really matter. You don’t remember much of anything before she arrived anyway. Oh speaking of which, it should all happen in a few seconds.” Enzo went silent. Tom paused for a few seconds, wondering what he was waiting for. </p>
