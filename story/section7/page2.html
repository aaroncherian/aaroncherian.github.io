  <p class = story> “You know for someone that hates winter you don’t seem all too bothered by the cold,” Tom commented. It was all he could think to say at the moment. </p>
  <p class = story> “Really, Tom? I think out of the two of us we know who hates winter the most,” Enzo replied. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom sighed and looked around. </p>
  <p class = story> There were scorch marks all over the bar, blackened bits of wood that someone, it seemed, had half-heartedly tried to cover up. These weren't burn marks from Lilah using her powers during the night he had just experienced, however. These were much worse, climbing high up the walls and across the floors. And as Tom examined the bar further he realized the majority of the tables and chairs were charred black as well. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom took a deep breath.</p>
  	<p class = story> “What is this, Enzo?” He asked.</p>
  	<p class = story> Enzo sighed.</p>
  	<p class = story> “Let’s not pretend like you haven’t already figured it out, Tom,” he said. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom shook his head, </p>
  	<p class = story> “No, no, this is just another hallucination. Something before the next memory. This isn’t real.”</p>
  	<p class = story> “Normally it wouldn’t be, you’d be seeing something else. But you figured out that trick. What you’re seeing here is actually what exists. The only thing that’s not real here is me. A congratulations of sorts are in order I guess. You haven’t ever gotten to this point.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom shivered, although strangely he didn’t feel quite as cold as he did before. </p>
  	<p class = story> “This has happened before then. Why?” He asked. </p>
