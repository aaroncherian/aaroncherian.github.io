  	<p class = story> Tom was silent, the truth being he was afraid to speak the words out loud. He glanced up and saw Enzo’s expectant gaze. </p>
  	<p class = story> “It was obvious really, so obvious. I must have realized after our first conversation. It’s just that I didn’t want to…” Tom trailed off. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Accept it?” Enzo finished. </p>
  <p class = story>	Tom nodded. </p>
  	<p class = story> “The reunion, that meeting, seven years later with all of us, it was just another hallucination, wasn’t it? Everyone being together again, it was all too good to be true,” Tom said, the words beginning to flow out from him.  “And then Ayano jut disappeared, and I realized something was wrong, but I still kept going on, acting like it could all still be okay. I didn’t want to accept it, that the only thing I held onto as real this entire time was a lie.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “I know, and I understand. We are the same person, after all,” Enzo responded. “But I think… I think I’m allowed to tell you more of the truth, now that you’ve come to accept it yourself.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Tell me,” Tom responded immediately, giving Enzo his full attention. </p>
  <p class = story> “Well, we can start with where we’re sitting now,” Enzo started. “What you see around you? This is no illusion, no memory, it’s the real bar, as it stands now. And one part of the reunion was true, it has been seven years since we were all together.” </p>
  <p class = story> Tom laughed into the empty night as realization struck him. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Of course, the night Ayano died, that was the last night we were together. It’s been seven years since she died.” </p>
