  <p class = story> Tom nodded slowly, processing the statement. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I need to remember, Enzo. What happened? To Bryan? Lilah? You?” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Oh well Bryan’s easy enough. He knocked out, and essentially attacked, an entire room of heroes. And pretty damn easily too. You convinced everyone that he was a threat, and they all believed you. It became a manhunt, a game of cat-and-mouse, trying to find a man who could always hear you coming,” Enzo said, and then frowned. “Say Tom, why did you work so hard to track him down? As far as I can remember you didn’t even work that hard to find Ayano’s killer.” There was a bit of reproach in his voice now. </p>
  	<p class = story> When Tom said nothing, Enzo shrugged and continued on, and a stray spark arced off his hand. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Well long story short, the heroes caught the villain. And they killed him. The end.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom expected to feel regret or sadness of sorts, but there was only numbness. </p>
  	<p class = story> “As for me and Lilah? That’s when all this happened,” Enzo said, gesturing to the burn marks.  “She came for us Tom. She came for us all. But it might be easier to show you.” </p>
