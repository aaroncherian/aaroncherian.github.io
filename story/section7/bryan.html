		<h2> Bryan </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> There was a hero standing in Bryan’s path as he tried to escape the police station. She planted her feet on the ground and smiled smugly at him. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m not blocking your way, am I?” She asked. Her voice was firm and confident, but her mind betrayed her. Bryan picked up her surface thoughts easily. </p>
  	<p class = story> She was baiting him. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan decidedly took a few steps in backwards. He reached a little deeper into her mind. What once took him upwards of half an hour he accomplished now in the span of a few seconds. By reading through her recent memories he could ascertain her power: full-body paralysis on contact.  </p>
  	<p class = story> He was almost overwhelmed by the rage that he sensed within her. Her calm demeanor was just a front. This hero was <i>angry</i>. Angry that she had been made to fight her fellow heroes because Bryan had lost control of his powers in the bar. Angry, because there had been one casualty that night, and it had been one of her own teammates that had fallen, inadvertently cut down by another hero. </p>
  <p class = story> <i>Sleep</i>, he told her. She slumped to the ground immediately. </p>
  <p class = story> It had only been two days since he had singlehandedly incapacitated a good portion of the heroes in the city just by ordering them to <i>sleep</i>.</p>
  <p class = story> He looked back into the station, at all the officers that were currently unconscious on their desks or on the floor. He took another glance at the hallway that lead to the particular prisoner he had just interrogated. </p>
  <p class = story> At last, after examining Gravitas’ mind he understood it all, everything behind Ayano’s death. And with that understanding came hope. He just needed to hunt a very specific person down. </p>
  <p class = story> The manhunt for him had started almost immediately after that night, but heroes and law-enforcement alike were still as of yet unaccustomed to dealing with his newfound abilities. It was a liberty he was sure he wouldn’t have for long. </p>
  <p class = story text-align = center> ---------</p>
  	<p class = story> Next they came from the sky. He had just cornered the man he was hunting down against the side of a building when he felt three of them enter the range of his powers. </p>
  	<p class = story> There was a man with shimmering outstretched wings that seemed to constantly be shifting in color and form hovering in front of Bryan, fluorescent energy spinning around him. A woman with eyes glowing a bright gold flew up from another side, shining veins pulsing along the arm she was pointing at Bryan. And finally from behind him there was a figure covered in slim steel armor, held aloft by a jetpack as the hero pointed a weapon that Bryan couldn’t quite identify at him. </p>
  <p class = story> Three heroes with ranged abilities that were meant to disable him from a distance outside his range of power. Three heroes that he had once fought side-by-side with. </p>
  	<p class = story> It was unfortunate for them that Bryan’s range had grown along with his powers. </p>
  	<p class = story> <i>Land on the nearest flat rooftop  . Then sleep.</i> Sending the commands to all three individuals over the distance took a staggering amount of power, leaving him lightheaded. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan leaned against the wall behind him, breathing a little heavily. He gave a glance over to the man, who was currently trying to sneak away. </p>
  	<p class = story> Stay, he ordered offhandedly. The man went rigid and froze in place, his eyes wide and terrified. His once pressed-suit and red tie were now crumpled and patched with dirt. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan used an arm to brace himself against the wall and set to work digging through the man’s looking for the information he wanted. After a few minutes he allowed himself a small smile. After so many dead ends, he finally had what he needed. A location and a time to meet the assassin he was looking for. All he had to do was evade capture until then.  </p>
  <p class = story text-align = center> --------- </p>
  	<p class = story> He only dared to walk out in the daytime from then on. The manhunt for him had been largely unpublicized to avoid public panic at the thought of a powerful telepath freely walking among them, so Bryan had believed he would be relatively safe among outdoors. Then they came for him silently. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan stared down, heart still pounding, sweat running down his face, at the hero that was currently sleeping on the concrete ground in front of him. This had been the closest call yet. The hero had been invisible, sneaking up almost within striking distance of him. He’d been taught, likely by Tom, to shield his mind, but fortunately for Bryan, not well enough to hide his thoughts at close quarters. It had taken two commands. One to make the hero reveal himself, one to put him to sleep. </p>
  	<p class = story> As the crowd started murmuring at the sudden appearance of the man in costume on the floor, Bryan quickly walked away, stumbling from exhaustion, fully aware that the hero had been holding a knife in his hand as he fell. </p>
  < p class = story text-align = center > --------- </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan tread carefully along the busy street. Each push from a passing civilian threatened to knock him over and it was by sheer force of will that he kept himself upright. Weeks of hiding and combat had been taking its toll. His mind was clouded by a constant fog from continuous use of his powers. It had been a long time since he had felt such weariness from using his powers. </p>
  	<p class = story> Still, he shivered in anticipation. This was the day he had been waiting for. The assassin he had been hunting down for the last few weeks was waiting for a meeting with a potential employer outside a local bakery just a few blocks away. Unfortunately for him, Bryan had intercepted that particular person, the man in the suit and red tie first. </p>
  	<p class = story> Of course, he would have been infinitely less worried about the whole situation if half the heroes in the city weren’t closing in on him at the moment.  They had been slowly circling him in, cutting off all escape routes. He had sensed their minds as they had walked into his range. They were launching an all-or-nothing gamble, an outright assault to take him down, secrecy be damned. </p>
  	<p class = story> For a moment Bryan wondered if Tom had risked joining operation. Part of him hoped that his former captain had, because Bryan had some questions that needed answering. But part of him knew that it was exactly because he wanted answers that Tom would never come anywhere near him. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan could sense the anticipation and tension in the air. More worryingly was the faint bloodlust hidden behind it as well. He closed his eyes and stopped moving. Several disgruntled civilians muttered angrily as they nearly ran into him. Instantly he felt the tension in every heroes’ mind spike. They suspected that he was about to make a move. </p>
   	<p class = story> They were absolutely right. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan used the one aspect of his power he had avoided using since he had discovered it that night in the bar. He <i>pushed</i> his emotion into everyone around him. In this case, it was panic. It was simple to call on the feeling and spread it out around him. </p>
  	<p class = story> There was a single moment of quiet before the entire block erupted into chaos. People ran about wildly, some primal part of them struck by fear and terror. Cars swerved as they tried to avoid civilians that ran into the street as the hysteria settled in on the drivers. Bryan barely gave it any thought as he began to run, pushing his muscles to their limits. He could tell that the heroes were thrown into disarray, a good portion of them being overtaken by anxiety and dread, while the other few that were outside his range or resisting him looked on in horror and confusion. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan ran past it all. </p>
  	<p class = story> The bakery came into view in the distance, and Bryan could see a slim man in baggy shorts and a tee-shirt walking away from the store. </p>
  <p class = story>  Bryan reached into the man’s mind and saw memories of a family man who would bring back cinnamon rolls for his kids at the start of every weekend. </p>
  <p class = story> Not the person he wanted. </p>
  	<p class = story> Bryan spun, looking around him, his heart racing as he started to panic himself. </p>
  	<p class = story> If he missed this chance then it would all be over for him. He would be caught, and he would likely die.  </p>
  	<p class = story> Acting in desperation he cast his mind out around him, flitting through the thoughts of everyone he could find, looking for anything that would stand out to him-</p>
  	<p class = story> There! </p>
  	<p class = story> It was a mind that contained the memories of not one, but many. It was the mind of a man who would charm his way into his target’s life before killing them. It was the mind of a woman who acted the part of a mechanic to gain entrance to her target’s home. It was the mind of a frail man who lay face-down as bait for an unfortunate hero in an icy alleyway. </p>
  	<p class = story> It was the mind of a person who could wear any face he wanted. </p>
  	<p class = story> Stop. He sent the command as he located his target, walking towards an unassuming woman in a yellow sundress. She was seated at a table outside the bakery, muscles now frozen in place against her will. He slid in across from her and reached into her mind. Her memories. </p>
  	<p class = story> He saw the memory of her driving a knife into the gut of the Scarlet Speedstress, not in this form, but that of a large, muscular man. </p>
  <p class = story> Bryan’s hands clenched in anger, but even in the anger there was a small feeling of triumph. Bryan showed the assassin her own memories of the night she killed the Scarlet Speedstress. Her eyes widened. </p>
  	<p class = story> He heard her thoughts whisper to him. </p>
    <p class = story> <i> You’re the telepath that they’ve been hunting. </i> </p>
  <p class = story>  He nodded. </p>
  	<p class = story> <i> How did you find me?</i> </p>
  <p class = story>  Bryan said nothing. </p>
  	<p class = story> <i> I won’t apologize for that night, if that’s what you want. It was purely business, and nothing else.  </i> </p>
  	<p class = story>  Part of him wondered if he should stay and reveal the truth about everything. </p>
  	<p class = story>  But the real truth was that he didn’t care. Selfish as it may have been, all he wanted to do was leave the city and never look back. He had no obligation to anyone anymore. And with this last act at least, he could avenge Ayano’s death. </p>
  	<p class = story>  He also knew that there was no going back from what he was about to do, he was crossing a line that he never would have crosses under the name Sanctum. But Sanctum had died that night in the bar. </p>
  	<p class = story>  Bryan gathered all the power he had left, draining every last bit he could find. This would require a series of precise orders, and it would take him weeks to recover from this expenditure, but it was a small price to pay, and even smaller compared to what the assassin in front of him was about to pay. </p>
  	<p class = story>  Bryan spoke the commands into her mind.  </p>
  <p class = story>  The look of horror that dawned on her face would haunt him every night for the rest of his life. </p>
