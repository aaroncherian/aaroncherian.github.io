  <p class = story> Tom woke as cold flecks of snow landed on his face. He raised his head, squinting in the darkness. The pale light of streetlamps shone in through broken windows, illuminating shards of glass that were slowly being blanketed by sheets of snow.</p>
  <p class = story> Tom hung his head back and found himself looking directly up at a rusted lamp swinging from side to side. Letting out a sigh, he watched frosty breath disperse into the air. </p>
  	<p class = story> He was reasonably certain he was still in the bar, because even in the wreckage that surrounded it he could pick out familiar remnants. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom’s train of thought was interrupted as he became aware that someone was sitting at the table with him. He lowered his head and saw Enzo across from him.
  	<p class = story> For a moment I thought you would actually be him,” Tom murmured. “But it’s just you, oh figment of my mind again, here to tell me that everything I think is real is a lie. You’re wearing a different face this time though.”
