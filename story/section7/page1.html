<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Tom woke to the feeling of cold snow against his face. He opened his eyes and lifted his head off the table. Surprisingly when he touched a hand to his cheeck it came back slick with flecks of melting snowflakes. </p>
  <p class = story> Darkness surrounded him. He heard a slight creaking above him, and looked up to see a lamp without a bulb swinging from side to side as it was pushed by the wind. The pale light of streetlamps shone in through broken windows, illuminating glistening shards of glass that littered the floor. Snow piled in through the broken windows, slowly creeping towards Tom.</p>
  <p class = story> Enzo sat across the table from him, leaning back in the bench as he regarded Tom silently.</p>
