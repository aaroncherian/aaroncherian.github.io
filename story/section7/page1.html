<p class = story> Tom opened his eyes and lifted his head off the table when he felt the cold snow against his face. He was wearing his jacket again and dressed in his civilian clothing. The snow storm that was raging outside had found its way inside the bar as well. </p>
<p class = story> Darkness surrounded him, and he looked up to see a lamp without a bulb swinging back and forth as it was pushed by the wind, creaking ever so slightly as it moved from side to side. The pale light of streetlamps shone in through broken windows, illuminating the glistening shards of glass that littered the floor. White frost slowly crept towards him as snow piled into the bar. </p>
<p class = story> There were scorch marks all over the bar, blackened bits of wood that someone, it seemed, had half-heartedly tried to cover up. Somehow, Tom knew that everything around him, in disorder and disarray, was real, not another figment of his imagination. The bar was abandoned, save for Enzo, who sitting across from him. Enzo sat back against the chair as he regarded Tom silently, seemingly unbothered by the cold. </p>
