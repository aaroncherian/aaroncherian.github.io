  <p class = story> Tom looked to Lilah for support, but she pointedly ignored his gaze. He turned back to Enzo, </p>
<p class = story> “Listen, Enzo. I just think you might need a little distance, just for a bit.” he said. “Shard contacted me a bit earlier, Headquarters wants her to head up a temporary team for a big job downtown with local police. She’ll need some heavy hitters, and I can recommend you for it. You need some time to grieve. We all do.” </p>
<p class = story> Enzo started to protest, but Tom cut him off, a bit more forceful with his tone now. </p>
<p class = story> “Do you think this is what Ayano would have wanted for us? Ignoring people in need to help track down her killer?” </p>
<p class = story> <i> “She would have wanted to be saving them herself!” </i> Enzo’s fist hit the table, small blue sparks shooting outward as he connected. </p>
<p class = story> There was a sharp cracking noise as the lightbulb hanging in the lampshade above them flickered and went out.</p>
<p class = story> “Lorenzo!” Lilah said sharply. </p>
<p class = story> Enzo sighed, and reached up to unscrew the bulb. </p>
	<p class = story> “Sorry,” he murmured. “I’ll get a replacement.” He trudged off in the direction of the bartender. </p>
