  <p class = story> “Listen, Enzo. You remember that team Shard was putting together to take down the Jailbirds?” He asked. “The police are just about done with their investigation, Headquarters wants her team deployed to the area soon. She’ll understand if you can’t go, but I think you should. You need some time away to grieve, we all do.” </p>
  <p class = story><i> And you need to let this go,</i> Tom thought. <i>Before-</i> </p>

  <p class = story>Enzo started to protest. Tom cut him off, more forcefully now. </p>

  <p class = story> “Do you think this is what Ayano would have wanted for us? We’re ignoring other people in need because we’re tracking down her killer.” </p>

  <p class = story> “What she would have wanted?” Enzo snapped suddenly. “She would have wanted to be saving them herself!” His fist hit the table. Small blue sparks shot outward as he connected. </p>

  <p class = story>There was a sharp <i>crack</i> as the lightbulb hanging in the lampshade above them flashed and went out.</p>

  <p class = story> “Lorenzo!” Lilah admonished sharply. </p>

  <p class = story>Enzo sighed, and reached up to unscrew the bulb. </p>

  <p class = story> “Sorry, guys. Didn’t mean to do that,” he murmured. “I’ll get a replacement. Just…I’m sorry.” He trudged off in the direction of the bartender. </p>
