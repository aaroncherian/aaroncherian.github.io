		<h2> Lilah </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> The combination of four heroes and one civilian made for an odd group as they walked through the burning neighborhood. Lilah looked around as they briskly passed by the smoldering remains of houses.</p>
<p class = story> There was a hero next to her dressed in a green costume. Simple, by standards of hero costumes. A mask covering just the area around his eyes, and different shades of green overlapping over his suit.  She assumed he was their leader, from the way the others seemed to defer to him. </p>
<p class = story>  On her other side was a man in a white mask with an equally white coat. He, from what Lilah could gather, was a telepath. It was how they had found her so quickly after she entered the fire, he had picked right up on her thoughts and who she was. </p>
<p class = story> There was a woman floating with them a few feet off the air, and her eyes, Lilah noted, were a dim shade of gold. And finally, there was a man dressed completely in black, walking behind them. </p>
<p class = story> She had heard their names mentioned at one point, but they slipped her mind now. </p>
<p class = story> The heroes flanked her, on the one hand protecting her from hostiles that they knew were in the area, but on the other hand, Lilah suspected that not all of them trusted her. </p>
<p class = story> But that wasn’t really a surprise, all things considered. </p>
<p class = story> Everywhere she looked there was fire. There was one kind of fire, the kind that could be put out by normal means. It licked the roofs of houses and the trunks of trees, painted orange and red. And then there was the second fire, the purple fire. This fire consumed, it writhed and moved through the streets in ways that fire could never naturally move, burning indiscriminately the non-living and the living alike. </p>
<p class = story> They stopped at a wall of violet flames that cut across a street and blocked their path. The hero in green looked towards Lilah. All of them did, except for the telepath. </p>
<p class = story> <i>They want to see if I am who I claim to be. </i></p>
<p class = story> Lilah heard music as she used her powers. </p>
<p class = story>  She had never known why, but it was the way it had always been. These flames, the purple ones before her, they <i>sung</i> to her. A choir, an orchestra, waiting for its conductor. Waiting for <i>her</i>.  </p>
<p class = story> They urged her to direct and lead them, to create a symphony in the inferno. She suddenly felt a desire to feed the fire, to make it <i>stronger</i>.</p>
<p class = story> But the screams of the burning people drowned out that music, and did away with that desire. Lilah reached towards the flame with her mind. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Pianissimo</i></p>
<p class = story> The song quieted and the flames in front of them disappeared. </p>
<p class = story> The other heroes were still, a heavy silence falling over them as they saw the flame bend to her will. Lilah walked out from behind them and stepped forward. She had no time to waste. </p>
<p class = story> The telepath followed suit, and then the rest did as well, reforming around her. </p>
<p class = story>  “It was brave of you to come back for your brother, Henry, if I remember his name correctly,” the man in green said. He gestured to the telepath. “Sanctum tells me returned to the country as soon as you heard about the attacks.” </p>
<p class = story> She had been studying music in Africa when she saw the news. A crew of fire-starters led by a man calling himself Phaestus had been terrorizing cities across the North American east coast, leaving a trail of burnt neighborhoods and countless deaths in their wake. </p>
<p class = story>  The news report had shown footage of the group and what made them so terrifying and unstoppable. Unnatural purple flames that moved almost as if they were alive, always forming a barricade that trapped civilians in their homes and streets, hunting down heroes with a strange ferocity. </p>
<p class = story> She had taken the first flight home and followed their trail of destruction, arriving at their next target just as they struck. </p>
<p class = story> “It was my responsibility to return. I knew Henry was never as restrained as I was with his powers, but I never imagined <i>this</i>,” Lilah said. They emerged onto a grassy area dotted with trees and benches that had been relatively untouched by the fire. “I never imagined he could grow so powerful. His fire spreads so far, far beyond anything I could ever do. That’s why I’m here to fix this.” </p>
<p class = story> “To save him?” the flying woman asked. Her voice rose in anger as she spoke. “You realize we have orders to kill him on sight, right? Someone needs to answer for the lives that he’s taken.” </p>
<p class = story> “You should remember Flare that the boy isn’t acting alone. <i>I</i> would prefer to end today without another casualty,” the hero in black said. His voice was soft, but the others gave him their full attention. “We have our kill orders, but I believe most of us would like to take him in alive, yes?” He looked to Lilah. </p>
<p class = story> “I’m aware of what your orders are,” Lilah stated. She let the sentence hang there in the air. </p>
<p class = story> The telepath was looking at her. </p>
<p class = story> <i>You know why I’m here, don’t you? But you haven’t told them.</i></p></p>
<p class = story> The man shrugged slightly, and Lilah felt a small surge of appreciation. He frowned suddenly and looked into the area ahead of them. </p>
<p class = story> A few seconds later the man in green starting speaking quietly. </p>
<p class = story> “Listen to what I’m about to tell you, but continue to act normally. Sanctum senses hostile intentions just beyond those trees. Flare, be ready to dodge. Umbra well… just do your thing. I’ll give you a path.” </p>
<p class = story>  “Understood Grove,” the flying woman said. The man in black nodded. </p>
<p class = story> “And Lilah, stay back. We’ll need your power to get close to-” Grove started, but was interrupted by a spinning ball of fire that came rocketing towards Flare. </p>
<p class = story> The hero’s eyes flashed a bright gold as she shot into the air, the missile streaking through the space she had just been occupying. Her veins seemed to pulse gold as energy gathered in her hands. </p>
<p class = story> Umbra stepped into the shadow of a tree. A darkness rose from the ground, flowing over his form like ink and covering it. It then descended again and Umbra melted into the shadows beneath him. </p>
<p class = story>  Five individuals stepped out of the trees. There was a man standing in front of the rest, smiling at them. Lilah recognized him from the reports. <i>Phaestus</i>. He held out a hand, and from the patches of burning grass rose flames that coalesced into a spinning orb of orange fire over his hand. After a few seconds however, he let the orb dissipate. </p>
<p class = story> “We weren’t expecting such company,” Phaestus called out. “But there’s no need for us to fight. We’re all people with powers here. We all know it’s like to live in a society that distrusts us just because of who we are.” </p>
<p class = story> “We might need backup,” Flare murmured, not taking her eyes off their opponents. </p>
<p class = story> Looking up, Lilah noticed that the golden energy surrounding Flare was pulsing. And with each pulse it a little bit brighter. </p>
<p class = story> “None available,” Grove replied softly, before calling out to Phaestus. “If you’re looking to inspire trust then you might just want to rethink your tactics, you know, burning innocent civilians and all.” </p>
<p class = story> “No one is innocent!” Phaestus spat out. “<i>These</i> people sit by and do nothing while everyone with powers is dragged away by people like your beloved mayor, who spent her term fighting for increased surveillance on anyone with powers.” </p>
<p class = story> Lilah also realized that the branches of the tree behind them were extending in the direction of the opposing group. It was a subtle, slow growth. She frowned, it wasn’t growing nearly long enough to reach their opponents. </p>
<p class = story> “Livewire? The Scarlet Speedstress?” Flare asked softly. </p>
<p class = story> “Searching for hostiles elsewhere. Rescuing civilians. Don’t need backup,” Grove said quietly, before raising his voice again. “It makes sense. People with power can be dangerous, and it doesn’t help when people like you prove that theory true.” </p>
<p class = story>  Then Lilah noticed Grove’s true objective. Shadows. Shadows of the tree branches that extended beyond the length of the trees, which <i>were</i> closing the gap between their two groups. </p>
<p class = story> “As expected from a government lapdog. You’ve allied with them, and why? They dress you up in pretty colors and put you on a pedestal for display,” Phaestus said. “You think you wear costumes to keep your identities safe from the public? No, it’s to make sure the public feels safe around <i>you</i>.” </p>
<p class = story> “He talks a lot,” Grove said wearily. </p>
<p class = story> For a moment, Lilah thought she saw the shadows of the branches ripple along their length. </p>
<p class = story> “So we’ll start with you heroes here, and then the rest of your city. And finally, your mayor!” Phaestus called out, laughing. </p>
<p class = story> “In the end, just another nutjob with a penchant for murder that also happens to be a pyromaniac. Is it bad that I’m disappointed?” Grove sighed. </p>
<p class = story> Sanctum nodded once. </p>
<p class = story> “Was that a nod of agreement or a nod to signal that everyone is in position?” Grove asked him, loudly enough that Phaestus could hear. The men and women behind him tensed, and fire began to move towards them. </p>
<p class = story> Sanctum shrugged. </p>
<p class = story> “Ah, I see. So both, then. Flare, if you would?” </p>

<p class = story> Flare unleashed golden energy in a line from her hand. It struck one man who was running towards them, condensing ambient fire into a bubble around himself. He went flying back towards Phaestus’ group, the fire around him exploding outwards and throwing the group into disarray. A stream of fire shot out from one woman’s hands as she stumbled towards Flare, and she shot up into the air. </p>
<p class = story> Umbra rose up from the shadows behind another man who was wielding his fire like a whip, grabbing him and pinning him to the ground. </p>
<p class = story> A woman ran out of the group towards the remaining three of them, and from her hands emerged a bright blue flame that trailed embers behind her. It was short and almost pointed in its nature. She wielded it like a knife as she ran straight for Grove. </p>
<p class = story> He remained completely still, and Lilah had to resist the urge to call out in warning. </p>
<p class = story> She quickly realized that a warning would have been unnecessary. The woman slashed out with her flame, but the man in green dodged it easily, his motions fluid and quick. The fire carved a smoking gash into the tree behind him. The man scowled as small flames began to appear on the wood. He grabbed hold of her arm, using her momentum to smash it against the tree. </p>
<p class = story> Lilah blinked as the bark of the tree grew, molding itself around her arm and pinning it in place. Grove slammed the woman’s head into the tree, not once, but twice, until she slumped down, held upright only by her arm. </p>
<p class = story> “Go! Umbra, with her!” Grove shouted at Lilah. </p>
<p class = story> Lilah looked towards Sanctum, who had his attention focused Phaestus. The flames in the man’s hand were extinguished as he clutched his head and fell to his knees. The telepath gave her a glance and pointed along a specific street. Lilah nodded, and she ran past the firestarters. Umbra melted into her shadow as she passed him. </p>
	<p class = story> The music of the flames grew and grew as she sprinted. They finally reached a climax when she reached a clearing consumed by purple flames that roared and twisted through the air. And she knew that at the epicenter of it all would be Henry. </p>
<p class = story> She ran through, using her powers to quench the flames as she did while feeling heat on her back as they reignited behind her. </p>
<p class = story> When she finally caught sight of her brother, he had his eyes closed, arcs of fire spinning in the air around him at a beat matching that of the music Lilah was hearing. </p>
<p class = story> He saw her, and the flames faltered for a moment and fell out of sync with the music. </p>
<p class = story> “Lilah?” He asked. “No, no you can’t be here!” </p>
<p class = story> “Oh, Henry,” she said. “Why?” Lilah could see shadows rippling as Umbra traveled towards him. </p>
<p class = story> “You wouldn’t understand. You always preferred to act like our powers didn’t exist, but I’m doing this for everyone like us. Everyone who’s told by our society that they need to be scared of their powers!” Henry said. </p>
<p class = story> Umbra rose up from the shadows behind Henry. </p>
<p class = story> “They should be. <i>We</i> should be,” Lilah said softly. “Our powers are made to hurt. How many have you killed just today alone?” </p>
<p class = story> The hero took a single step towards her brother. Lilah saw her brother’s glance behind him quickly, and suddenly the entire ground ignited with waves of fire that swept out from around him. Lilah reached out with her powers, but it was beyond anything that she could hope to stop. The hero stumbled back, trying to fade into the shadows, but flames twisted around him and roared skyward in a pillar of fire. </p>
<p class = story> “See?!” Her brother cried out, smiling as he looked at the roaring flames. “Look at this <i>power</i>. Not even Mom could do anything like this. <i>This</i> is what happens when we embrace our powers, Lilah. Its freedom, and you can’t convince me to give this up!” </p>
<p class = story> <i>I didn’t come to convince you, Henry.</i>
<p class = story> The column of flames in front of her sang its song clearly, and finally, Lilah took her place as its conductor. </p>
<p class = story> In that instant, that single column of fire belonged to her. </p>
<p class = story> And in that same instant, she knew she could save Umbra. She sensed him in the flames. He was burned badly, but he still had a chance at living if she quieted the flames. Yet, she would never again have the same opportunity or power to do what needed to be done. </p>
<p class = story> She took the song and began to give it new direction. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Allegro</i>
<p class = story> The flames began to spin faster. They consumed Umbra. Lilah tried to give him as quick a death as she could. Henry stepped back in confusion. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Double-time</i>
<p class = story> The column began to pulse. Flames expanded and contracted as they spun. Henry looked over at her, shouting something at her, but all Lilah could hear was the symphony of fire. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Forte</i></p>
<p class = story> The pillar exploded outwards, and Lilah watched as her brother was consumed by the flames. </p>
