<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> The combination of four heroes and one civilian made for an odd group as they walked through the burning neighborhood. Lilah looked around as they briskly walked by the still smoldering remains of houses. There was a hero next to her dressed in a simple green costume. From the way the others deferred to him, she assumed he was their leader. On the other side of her was a man in a white mask with an equally white coat. He, from what Lilah could gather, was the telepath. It was how they had found her so quickly after she entered the fire, he had picked right up on her thoughts and known exactly why she had come. There was a woman floating with them a few feet off the air, and her eyes, Lilah noted, were a dim shade of gold. And finally, there was a man dressed completely in black, walking behind them. </p>
  <p class = story>  They flanked her, on the one hand protecting her from any potential enemies, and she had heard them mention that there were a hostiles few in the area, but on the other hand, Lilah knew that some of them harbored suspicions about her. </p>
  <p class = story> Everywhere she looked there was fire. There was the first kind of fire, the kind that could be put out by normal means. It licked the roofs of houses and the trunks of trees. And then there was the second fire. This fire <i>consumed</i>, it writhed and moved through the streets in ways that fire should never be able to move. It burned indiscriminately the non-living and the living alike, shrouding them all in violet flames. </p>
  <p class = story> They stopped at a wall of purple flames that cut across a street and blocked their path. The hero in green nodded at Lilah. This was why they had brought her along, after all. </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah heard music as she used her powers. She had never known why, but it was the way it had always been. These flames, the purple ones before her, they <i>sung</i> to her. They urged her to create flames of her own, to add to the song and create a symphony in the inferno. </p>
  <p class = story> But the screams of the burning people drowned out the fire. Lilah reached towards the flame with her mind. </p>
  <p class = story>  <i> Pianissimo </i> </p>
  <p class = story> The song quieted and the flames in front of them disappeared. </p>
  <p class = story> “You really do have his powers,” the floating hero next to her stated. Lilah nodded. </p>
  <p class = story> “It was brave, you know, coming back for your brother,” the man in green said. He gestured to the telepath. ”My teammate here says you returned to the country as soon as you heard about the fires.” </p>
  <p class = story> “I should never have left,” Lilah said. They emerged onto a grassy area dotted with trees and benches that had been relatively untouched by the fire. “I knew he never tried to restrain himself like I did with his powers. I just never imagined, <i> this </i>.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “You realize we have orders to kill him on site,” the woman said, her voice rising. “This neighborhood? It’s gone. How many people do you think will have died by the end of today because of your brother and his little gang of fire-starters?”</p>
  	<p class = story> “<i>I</i> would, however, prefer to end today without another casualty,” the hero in black said. His voice was soft, but the others gave him their full attention. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m aware of your orders,” Lilah responded tersely. </p>
  <p class = story> Anything else Lilah would have said was interrupted by a spinning ball of fire that came rocketing towards the woman next to her. </p>
  <p class = story> The hero’s eyes flared a bright gold as she shot into the air, the missile streaking through the space she had just been occupying. Her veins seemed to pulse gold as energy gathered in her hands.
  <p class = story> Darkness shrouded the form of the hero in black as he melted into the shadows beneath him. </p>
  	<p class = story> Five individuals stepped out of the trees. There was a man standing in front of the rest, smiling at them. He held out a hand, and from the patches of burning grass rose flames that coalesced into a spinning orb of orange fire over his hand. He reached out another hand and a second sphere spun into existence. He spread his hands out. All of the individuals behind him reached out their hands as well, some of them creating fires, others manipulating the fire around them. </p>
   <p class = story> “There’s no need for us to fight,” the man holding the orbs of fire called out. “We’re all powered people here. We all know it’s like to live in a society that distrusts us just because of who we are. You think you wear costumes to keep your identities safe from the public? No, it’s to make sure the public feels safe around you, safe with individuals that could kill them at a moment’s notice around them.”</p>
  <p class = story> The hero in green shrugged, sharing a glance with the woman in the air. </p>
  <p class = story> “That’s not exactly news to us. Also, if you’re looking to inspire trust then you might just want to rethink your tactics. Burning down neighborhoods full of innocents doesn’t exactly help your case out,” he said nonchalantly. </p>
  <p class = story> “No one is innocent!” the man wielding fire spat out. “<i>These</i> people sit by and do nothing while everyone with powers is dragged away. We start with them, and then we move on to the greater culprits, like your beloved mayor, who’s spent her term urging the government to round every person with powers up and keep tabs on them.” </p>
  <p class = story> Looking up, Lilah noticed that the energy around the flying woman’s arm was a bit brighter than before. She also realized that the branches of a tree behind them were extending in the direction of the opposing group. It was subtle, not nearly close enough to reach them, but then she realized that more importantly, the shadows of its branches had extended over the distance between them. For a moment she thought she saw the shadows ripple along their length. </p>
  <p class = story> “Yes, yes,” the hero responded. “Thanks for indulging me with the details of your little schemes and such. But with that I suppose I can stop stalling.” </p>
  <p class = story> The woman fired out a burst of golden energy that struck one of the fire-starters. Golden energy coursed over his body and he collapsed. She shot up into the air, dodging the two orbs of fire that suddenly went spinning her way. The hero in black rose out of the shadows behind another man, grabbing him and pinning him to the ground. </p>
  <p class = story> A woman ran out of the group towards the three of them, and from her hands emerged a bright blue flame that trailed embers behind her. It was short and almost pointed in its nature. She wielded it like a knife as she ran straight for the man in green. </p>
  <p class = story> He remained completely still, and Lilah resisted the urge to call out in warning.</p>
  <p class = story> She quickly realized that a warning would have been unnecessary. The woman slashed out with her flame, but the man in green dodged it easily, his motions fluid and quick. The fire carved a smoking gash into the tree behind him. The woman lunged at him, but once again he stepped to the side. This time however, the man grabbed ahold of her arm and used her momentum to smash it into a tree nearby. Lilah blinked as the tree suddenly seemed to mold itself around her arm, the bark of the trunk growing around it, pinning it in place. The hero slammed the woman’s head into the tree, not once, but twice, until she slumped down, her pinned arm preventing her from sliding completely into the ground.</p>
  <p class = story> “Go!” He shouted at Lilah and signaled to the hero in black. Lilah looked towards the telepath, who had his attention focused on the leader of the other group. The flames in the man’s hand were extinguished as he clutched his head and fell to his knees. The hero gave her a glance and pointed along a specific street. Lilah nodded, and she ran past the fire-starters. The man in black melted into her shadow as she passed him. </p>
  <p class = story> There was a rumb, and as Lilah looked back she could see dirt spraying into the air as roots ripped out of the ground. </p>
  <p class = story> She turned away and sprinted as fast as she could. The song of the flames grew as she continued. </p>
  	<p class = story> Finally, she saw a clearing consumed by fire, purple flames roaring and twisting through the air, and she knew that he would be in the center of it. She ran through, using her powers to quench the flames as she did while feeling heat on her back as they reignited behind her. </p>
  	<p class = story>  When she finally caught sight of her brother, he had his eyes closed, arcs of fire spinning in the air around him at a beat, matching the timing of the music Lilah was hearing. </p>
  	<p class = story> And then he saw her. The flames faltered for a moment and fell out of sync with the music. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Lilah?” He asked. “No, no you can’t be here!” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Oh, Henry,” she said. “Why are you doing this?” Lilah could see the hero in black slowly forming up out of the shadows behind her brother. </p>
  	<p class = story> “You wouldn’t understand. You always preferred to act like our powers didn’t exist, but I’m doing this for everyone like us. Everyone who’s told by our society that they need to be scared of their powers!” Henry said. </p>
  	<p class = story> “They should be. <i>We</i> should be,” Lilah said softly. “Our powers are made to hurt. How many have you killed just today alone?” </p>
  	<p class = story> The hero took a single step towards her brother. Lilah saw her brother’s glance behind him quickly, and suddenly the entire ground ignited with waves of fire that swept out from around him. Lilah reached out with her powers, but it was beyond anything that she could hope to stop. The hero stumbled back, trying to fade into the shadows, but fire twisted around him and roared skyward in a pillar of fire. </p>
  	<p class = story> “See?!” Her brother cried out, s¬miling as he looked at the roaring flames. “Look at this <i>power</i>. Not even Mom could do anything like this. <i>This</i> is what happens when we embrace our powers, Lilah. Its freedom, and you can’t convince me to give this up!” </p>
  	<p class = story> “I didn’t come to convince you,” Lilah whispered. </p>
  <p class = story> The column of flames in front of her sang its song clearly, and finally, Lilah let herself give in to the music of the fire. </p>
  	<p class = story> She took the song and began to give it new direction. </p>
  	<p class = story> <i> Allegro </i>
  	<p class = story> The flames began to spin faster. Henry stepped back in confusion.
  	<p class = story> <i> Double-time </i></p>
  	<p class = story> She could see the column begin to pulse. Flames expanded and contracted as they spun. Henry looked over at her, shouting something at her, but all Lilah could hear was the symphony of fire. </p>
  	<p class = story> <i> Forte </i> </p>
  	<p class = story> The pillar exploded outwards, and Lilah watched as her brother was consumed by the flames. </p>
