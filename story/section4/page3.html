  <p class = story> Exhaustion was written over Bryan’s face and into the darkening lines under his eyes. His eyes were unfocused, staring down at the table, but he snapped to attention when he heard his name. Tom’s worries, however, went beyond Bryan’s physical state. The telepath had pushed himself to his limits lately, and any hero that strained his or her own powers was at risk of losing control of them. And with Bryan, that was not a possibility he wanted to entertain.
  <p class = story> Bryan’s gaze sharpened as he looked at Tom, determination and resolve filling his face, but not quite managing to mask the tiredness completely. </p>
  <p class = story> Letters arranged themselves on the table in front of Tom. </p>
  <p class = story> <i> I’m the one choosing to examine their minds Tom. And I’ll read however many minds it takes.</i></p>
  <p class = story>Tom looked to Lilah for support, her attention was on Bryan, and he got the distinct feeling that she was purposefully avoiding his gaze. He turned back to Enzo. </p>
