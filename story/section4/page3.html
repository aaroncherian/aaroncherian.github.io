  <p class = story> Exhaustion was written over Bryan’s face and into the darkening lines under his eyes. His eyes were unfocused, staring down at the table. He snapped to attention when he heard his name. Of course Tom’s worries went beyond Bryan’s physical state. He had pushed himself to his limits lately, and any hero that strained his or her own powers was at risk of losing control of them. And with Bryan, that was not a possibility he wanted to entertain.
  <p class = story> Bryan’s gaze sharpened as he looked at Tom, determination and resolve filling his face, but not quite managing to wipe the tiredness from it. </p>
  <p class = story> Letters arranged themselves on the table in front of Tom. </p>
  <p class = story> <i> I’m the one choosing to examine their minds Tom. And I’ll read however many minds it takes.</i></p>
