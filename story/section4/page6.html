  	<p class = story> “What we did was a mistake,” she hissed back. “Ayano had just died, I wasn’t thinking straight, and we were alone on patrol. And I live with that guilt, everyday wondering if he’ll find out. But right now? He’s focused on finding Ayano’s murderers, how many of them there may be, and I’ll be right there helping him out, not getting in his way.” She stood up, pulling her arm away, before pausing for a moment. </p>
	<p class = story> “You were right, though. About getting distance.” She said. Tom looked up at her questioningly, but she looked towards the door. </p>
	<p class = story> “I asked Shard about joining that team, earlier you know? And she rejected me, of course she did. Because she doesn’t trust me,” Lilah continued. “No one outside our team does. She’ll take Enzo, who anyone can see is barely keeping his powers in check. But she won’t take me, just because of my family’s history. </p>
<p class = story> “I see the way everyone looks at me, the sister of the man who once terrorized this city with his flames. So yeah, I tried to get some distance. From Ayano’s death. Even you. But if I’m to stay here, then I’ll see this through. For Ayano, and her family.” Lilah started to walk away, but then stopped. Tom closed his eyes, expecting the memory to come to an end. </p>
<p class = story> He heard Lilah say something else. </p>
<p class = story> “Say Tom, isn’t any of this weird to you?” </p>
