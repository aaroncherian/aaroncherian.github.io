  <p class = story> Bryan rose up slowly after Enzo. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Are you going back to Headquarters?” Lilah asked. Bryan nodded, and Tom knew that he had in mind to interrogate more suspects. Lilah said nothing for a few moments, before nodding back. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Be careful,” she said. With that, Bryan left the bar, leaving the two of them alone at the table. Lilah looked away from Tom, and started to gather her things. </p>
  	<p class = story> “He’s pushing himself to his limit Lilah,” Tom hissed. “If you let him keep going like this, he’ll lose control.” Lilah said nothing, and started to rise. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Is that what you want?” Tom asked, grabbing her arm. “For him to find out about us because he accidently reads one of our minds?” Lilah looked back at Tom, her eyes filled with anger. </p>
