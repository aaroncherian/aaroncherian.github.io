  <p class = story> Lilah rose, waiting a few seconds before answering. When she spoke, her voice was slow and deliberate. </p>
<p class = story> “There is no us, Tom. There should have never been an us. That night was a mistake. Ayano was gone, none of us apart from you knew how to grieve her death. Bryan and Lorenzo still haven’t yet. Lorenzo’s been searching day and night for suspects to keep himself busy. Bryan’s been pushing himself to exhaustion so he doesn’t have to feel the grief. And back then I just tried to avoid it. In any way possible.” </p>
<p class = story> The words stung, and Tom had to push down his impulse to snap back at her.</p>
<p class = story> “You know, when Ayano first came I was a bit jealous of her,” Lilah said after a few moments. “She got the respect of the other heroes immediately for taking on her mother’s mantle. The city already loved the Scarlet Speedstress, they didn’t even notice that there was a different person wearing the mask now, all they needed to see the red streak of her powers.</p>
<p class = story> “When anyone sees my power all they see are the flames of the man who once terrorized the city. I’m a reminder to them of the city burning. Even Ayano avoided me when she first started.”</p>
<p class = story> Tom looked up in surprise.</p>
<p class = story> “She did?”</p>
<p class = story> “Of course she did, just like everyone else. But then one night on patrol she stopped and asked. About me, my brother, the night the city burned, all of it. And after that she didn’t care anymore. Just like that.</p>
<p class = story> “That’s why I’m not stopping Bryan. Because she didn’t deserve to die alone in that alleyway. The city needed a person like her. ”</p>
