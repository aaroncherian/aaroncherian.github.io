<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Bryan rose up slowly after Enzo. </p>
	<p class = story> “Going back to base?” Lilah asked. Bryan nodded. Planning to interrogate more suspects, no doubt. Lilah smiled and held out a closed fist. </p>
<p class = story> “Give ‘em hell Bry,” she said. Bryan returned the fist bump with a smile of his own before leaving the two of them alone at the table. </p>
<p class = story> Lilah avoided looking directly at Tom, but he didn't miss how her smile faded as Bryan walked away. </p>
<p class = story> “He’s a good guy, you know.”</p>
  <p class = story>  Those were the first direct words she had spoken to him in a while. Lilah started to gather together her belongings.</p>
<p class = story> “You can pretend that you’re worried about him Tom, but I know what you’re really worried about. You don’t want him to find out about what we did.” </p>
<p class = story> “And you do?” Tom asked. “You want him to find out about <i>us</i> because he accidently reads one of our minds?”</p>
