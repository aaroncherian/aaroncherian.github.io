  <p class = story> Bryan rose up slowly after Enzo. </p>
	<p class = story> “Are you going back to Headquarters?” Lilah asked. Bryan nodded, and Tom knew that he planned to interrogate more suspects. Lilah smiled and held out a closed fist. </p>
<p class = story> “Give ‘em hell Bryan,” she said. Bryan returned the fist bump with a smile of his own before leaving the two of them alone at the table. </p>
<p class = story> Lilah’s smile faded as he left. </p>
<p class = story> “He’s a good guy, you know.” Tom looked up in surprise. Those were the first direct words she had spoken to him in a while. She started to gather together her belongings, as she continued.</p>
<p class = story> “You can pretend that you’re worried about him, Tom, but I know what you’re really worried about. You don’t want him to find out about what we did.” </p>
<p class = story> “And you do?” Tom asked. “You want him to find out about us because he accidently reads one of our minds?”</p>
