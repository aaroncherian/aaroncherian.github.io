  <p class = story> “We can’t keep doing this! Using our patrol time to hunt down people that might just happen to have the slightest connection to Ayano! Look at Bryan, he’s barely keeping a lid on his powers as it is, and every time we have him search through someone’s mind it gets worse!” Tom said as he gestured to Bryan. </p>
  <p class = story> Exhaustion was written all over Bryan’s face and in the darkening lines under his eyes. His eyes themselves were unfocused, staring down at the table, only snapping to attention when he heard his name. His recent lack of awareness during conversations worried Tom even more. For Bryan, losing focus also meant the possibility of him losing control of his powers, and he worried that Bryan could accidentally pick up something from his mind. That was not a possibility he wanted to entertain. </p>
