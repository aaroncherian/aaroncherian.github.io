  <p class = story> When he opened them, he was alone in an empty bar. Tom sat there for a few minutes, staring down at the table as snow brushed past his face.</p>
  <p class = story> “I’m so sorry,” he whispered, before standing up.</p>
  <p class = story>Oddly, even though more snow had piled into the bar he didn’t feel as cold as earlier. </p>
  <p class = story>He looked out into the street.</p>
  <p class = story>And then Tom decided it was time to leave. Not just the bar, but the city itself. <a href = "Dee.html">He would leave it behind</a>, all of it.</p>
  <p class = story>He allowed himself a small smile. Starting a new life elsewhere. Yes, he could do that. </p>
  <p class = story>Tom walked along the bar, past ruins and ashes to the door, and as he reached for the handle he heard a voice behind him.</p>
