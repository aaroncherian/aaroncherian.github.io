		<h2> Chihiro </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">

  <p class = story>  Chihiro walked through a city that she didn’t quite recognize anymore. </p>
	<p class = story> This district, specifically, was in shambles. It was the district that she had run through at the end of every patrol, every day. She had always taken the same path to the bar. </p>
	<p class = story> The path was the same, but everything else was different. It had been a busy, noisy area once, crowded with heroes and civilians alike. Now it was desolate. People had moved back over the years, but anyone who so much as glanced at the houses could tell that living conditions were poor. </p>
	<p class = story> Her boots crunched through the snow as she walked. </p>
	<p class = story> She was tempted to test her powers, to see if she could still speed her way over to the bar, but the slippery conditions presented a large hazard. </p>
	<p class = story> Part of her knew that the ice was just an excuse, because the truth was that Chihiro was afraid. She was afraid that over the almost eight years she had spent locked up in her own mind, she had forgotten how to use her own powers. </p>
	<p class = story> It was like a fog had settled on her mind for all those years, and then one day it cleared away and Chihiro remembered exactly who she was. And as she looked up, fully conscious and aware of herself, she saw a man standing up from the side of her bed before walking out the door. Whoever he was, he had given her a second chance. Pieced together her mind and made it whole. </p>
<p class = story> That had been a year ago, a year that she had spent examined by doctors that tried to explain her miraculous recovery. A year that she had spent avoiding using her powers. A year in which she learned about about the murder of her own daughter in an alleyway. </p>
	<p class = story> Because Chihiro hadn’t been there, Ayano had taken her place as the Scarlet Speedstress. And because of that, she had died. </p>
	<p class = story> Chihiro intended to honor her brave daughter’s memory to her dying breath. </p>
	<p class = story> She paused briefly as she saw a small crowd to the side of the streets. Police cars were parked in the vicinity, as was an ambulance. </p>
	<p class = story> Curiosity drove her towards the scene and into the crowd. The civilians were being kept a distance away, but Chihiro could see a black body bag on a stretcher. </p>
	<p class = story> She made eye contact with a woman next to her. </p>
	<p class = story> “What happened?” </p>
		<p class = story>“They found a man dead outside. Not sure why, but if I were to guess he probably got caught out in that storm last night. Poor guy probably froze to death.” </p>
	<p class = story> Chihiro nodded, and went on her way. </p>
	<p class = story> Eventually she found herself in front of a ruined building with shattered windows, charred wood, and upheaved furniture. It was hard to reconcile <i>this</i> building with the way the bar had last looked when she had seen it. </p>
		<p class = story> Gingerly, Chihiro opened the door and stepped inside, examining the interior. </p>
<p class = story> It was a mess, and she was the proud new owner of it. </p>
	<p class = story> Chihiro immediately began thinking of where to start with renovations. She would rebuild it, tear it down and start anew if she had to. </p>
	<p class = story> It would be the brightest and loudest place on the street, bringing people to wander in out of pure curiosity. </p>
	<p class = story> And maybe it would bring heroes. </p>
	<p class = story> Maybe, just maybe, it would bring people with powers, looking to make a difference. </p>
<p class = story> She turned around as the door swung open behind her. </p>
	<p class = story> A young woman stood in the doorway, apparently as surprised to see Chihiro as Chihiro was to see her. </p>
	<p class = story> “Damn, he was right again. He’ll never let me live this down,” the woman muttered. Chihiro raised an eyebrow. </p>
	<p class = story> “Can I help you?” She asked. </p>
	<p class = story> “Yeah, actually, you can. A friend of mine sent me here, he knew you had returned,” the woman responded, marching into the bar and looking around. </p>
	<p class = story> Chihiro frowned. </p>
	<p class = story> “Did he now? And who might this friend of yours be?” </p>
	<p class = story> The woman waved off the question. </p>
	<p class = story> “Let’s just say he’s a bit of a know-it-all and leave it at that. More importantly, he knows <i>why</i><p class = story>  you returned, Chihiro, and he wants to help,” she answered. </p>
	<p class = story>“What kind of help could this anonymous friend of yours give me?” Chihiro asked warily.</p>
	<p class = story> The woman shrugged as she walked through the tables. </p>
	<p class = story> “Well, he sent me.” The woman raised a hand and from a table a few feet away from her a jacket floated into the air. She twitched her hand slightly and it shook itself free of the snow that was covering it. She frowned and with another gestured tossed it to the side. </p>
	<p class = story> “I want to help,” she said after a few moments, looking back at Chihiro. </p>
	<p class = story> Looking at her, Chihiro couldn’t help but be reminded of Ayano, who would have been around the same age when she had taken on the mantle of the Scarlet Speedstress. </p>
	<p class = story> Chihiro smiled, </p>
	<p class = story> “Well you see, I’m old and my muscles can’t do as much work as they used to. I’ll need your help rebuilding this place. That’s where we start.” </p>
	<p class = story> Yes, she was sure of it now. The heroes would come back, and when they did, she would be there to help them. </p>
