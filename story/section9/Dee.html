		<h2> Dee </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> For the first time in four years, Tom stood in front of the bar. </p>
<p class = story> Dee stood not quite next to him, but not too distanced either. This entire portion of the city had fallen into ruin along with its heroes. Some parts had recovered, eventually. But others, like this street, had been ransacked and abandoned. The bar had suffered the worst of it. </p>
<p class = story>  If she were to guess she might say that might have been the result of anything from teenagers curious about the interior of the extremely exclusive bar to criminals that had taken out their anger against the heroes on the bar. </p>
	<p class = story> They both stood in silence before the door. </p>
	<p class = story> “You didn’t have to come with me, you know. It’s a dangerous place,” Tom finally said. </p>
	<p class = story> “I was the one who told you to come back here, wasn’t I? I couldn’t exactly leave you to do this alone,” Dee responded. “Besides, what’s there to fear? If anyone tries to give us trouble I’ll give them a very strong talking to and then you can take care of the rest.” </p>
	<p class = story> She saw a ghost of a smile on his face at that. He had finally begun to smile more recently, after keeping that same empty look for so long. Even after they had left the city altogether, something about him had been lost that night the bar burned down. Something that he had left behind in the city. </p>
	<p class = story> He’d told her about the affair shortly afterwards. </p>
	<p class = story> To say that had led to some rough patches in their relationship would be an understatement.</p>
<p class = story> But they came back to each other, as they always did. </p>
	<p class = story> “I think I’m good for today,” Tom said quietly. </p>
	<p class = story> Dee nodded. </p>
	<p class = story> “Tomorrow then?” She asked. </p>
	<p class = story> “Yeah, tomorrow.” </p>
<p class = story> They started to walk away, but Tom stopped. Dee turned to look back at him. </p>
	<p class = story> “I think this is what I’ve needed,” he said. “Thanks, Dee.” </p>
	<p class = story> Dee rolled her eyes. </p>
	<p class = story> “You’re welcome you sappy twit.” </p>
	<p class = story> She kept walking forward before she realized that Tom had yet to follow. When she looked back over her shoulder, Tom was staring back at the bar, an odd expression on his face. </p>
	<p class = story> “I have to go back,” he said, walking away from her. </p>
	<p class = story> “Tom?” She called out. As she stepped forward to follow, some part of her urged her not to walk in that direction. </p>
	<p class = story> Dee suddenly had a very strong feeling that she should walk away from the bar and into the next street. She set out walking briskly in that direction. After she turned the corner, she stopped, all of a sudden at a loss for what she wanted to do. </p>
	<p class = story> She looked back, curious as to why she had even walked here in the first place. </p>
	<p class = story> Then she began to see things. </p>
	<p class = story> It was like someone had set up a projector in front of her and started a movie. Dee felt a little unsettled as she realized that the image wasn’t exactly something she could un-see. It stayed centered in her line of vision as she moved her head around. </p>
	<p class = story> Then she heard Tom’s voice coming from the image. It began to move, and on it Dee saw a man standing there. She frowned, the face looked vaguely familiar, although she couldn’t place it. Tom’s voice continued to speak, and the man responded. Dee began to place his face, having remembered seeing it on the news. A criminal of some sort, although she couldn’t place the name. </p>
	<p class = story> Somehow, Dee realized that she was watching a memory. And not just any memory, but Tom’s memory. </p>
<p class = story> And so she stood there and listened to their conversation. </p>
<p class = story> She listened as they discussed the murder of the Scarlet Speedstress. </p>
<p class = story> The memory changed to another conversation, this time with a woman. Dee recognized her immediately, Sensory, the hero responsible for the death of the first Scarlet Speedstress. She had heard about that incident in detail from Tom. </p>
<p class = story> She listened as Tom made false promises to her. </p>
	<p class = story> Here was another memory, this time with other heroes. Some, like Shard, Dee recognized. Others, she didn’t. </p>
	<p class = story> She listened as they plotted the killing of one of their own. </p>
	<p class = story> The next memory was of the woman Lilah and Tom, showing her just enough that if she hadn’t known already about the affair, she would have then. </p>
	<p class = story> She watched that one the whole way through, refusing to look away. </p>
	<p class = story> There were more. Tom inciting heroes to pursue Sanctum, a hero Tom had told her little about. Enzo burning in front of him. Lilah dying on the ground. </p>
	<p class = story> Slowly, the memories ended. She didn’t know where they came from, but somehow she knew they told the truth. </p>
	<p class = story> Dee marched her way back into the bar. Tom was sitting alone at a table, all the way in the back. </p>
	<p class = story> As she walked over, he looked at her in surprise. </p>
	<p class = story> “Dee, how’d you get in here?!” He whispered. “How did they not check for your identification at the door?” </p>
	<p class = story> Dee stared back at him, suddenly at a loss for words. </p>
	<p class = story> Tom smiled at her, more widely than she’d seen in years. </p>
	<p class = story> “Well now that you’re here, care to take a seat? We’re just waiting for Ayano to show up, and then the old team will be back together. Four years is a long time.” He exclaimed. </p>
	<p class = story> “We?” Dee asked. Tom looked around, </p>
	<p class = story> “Yeah, the whole team’s back together. I’ve told you about them, right? Enzo, Lilah, and Bryan?” </p>
	<p class = story> “Why are you doing this, Tom?” </p>
	<p class = story> His face suddenly went slack, all emotion wiped away. </p>
	<p class = story> “Because I must never forget,” he whispered. “I must never allow myself to forget the things I’ve done, and whenever I believe I’ve found happiness, I must always come back to remember why I don’t deserve it.” </p>
	<p class = story> A moment later his expression filled with life again. </p>
	<p class = story> He scooched over in the seat. </p>
	<p class = story> “Oh deal with it Enzo. Take a seat, Dee?” He asked. </p>
	<p class = story> Dee looked at him for a few seconds more. </p>
	<p class = story> “Not tonight, Tom,” she said shaking her head. “I’ll be waiting at home.” </p>
	<p class = story> As Dee walked out the bar she took off her wedding ring and slipped it into her pocket. </p>
