  <p class = story> As he opened his eyes, he saw the bar alight in purple flame. It started with the candles. Candle wicks burnt to a crisp and were reborn in wisps of fire that left behind ashes and stumps of molten wax. They were meager sources of fire, but those small flames, however, swept over other flammable items in the bar, all of which soon combusted as well. Plants and tablecloths burst into flame as Lilah raised her conductor’s baton. </p>
  <p class = story> The violet flame circled Tom protectively. Lines of fire suddenly spread throughout the bar like a grid, forcing fighting heroes to separate and confining them to their own squares as they were blocked by rising walls of fire. The situation, however, was still incredibly precarious. All it would take was one hero that dared to defy the flames for the fighting to start anew. </p>
  <p class = story> Even influenced by Bryan’s anger, her hands were steady as she moved her baton in quick motions. She turned her gaze towards Bryan and clenched her fists. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Bryan you <i>will</i> stop this!” Lilah snapped. Her voice was decisive and firm. </p>
  <p class = story> Bryan paused, and the pain Tom was feeling subsided as the anger weighing him down began to lift. He gazed at the flames for a few moments before looking around him. </p>
  <p class = story> Pieces of glasses were strewn across the floor, tables upended, and the heroes stood glaring at each other, each silently daring another to make the first move. He looked towards Lilah, and after a moment her eyes widened before she slumped down unconscious across the table. </p>
  <p class = story> The fire around them dissipated. </p>
