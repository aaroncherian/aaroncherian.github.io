<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> As Tom opened his eyes, he saw the bar alight in purple flame. </p>
  <p class = story> Relief flooded Tom as he saw Lilah stand firm, framed by her own fire. </p>
  	<p class = story> Small flammable objects combusted first, releasing small bursts of purple fire into the air. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah swung an arm out in one direction, and the flames joined together. She brought the arm back towards her, and the fire spread out, consuming larger objects, creating more flames that added to its volume. </p>
  	<p class = story> Remarkably, even though she had to be under the same influence of anger that Tom was, Lilah’s hands were steady as she conducted the fire. The anger that Tom had briefly glimpsed on her face was gone now, replaced by an expression that seemed to him … peaceful? </p>
  	<p class = story> She looked towards Tom, no doubt wondering why he was acting so strangely. As he strained against Bryan’s powers, she smiled at him. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’ve got this, Tom.” </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah turned her gaze to the rioting heroes. She reached out a single hand, and fire gathered over it. </p>
  	<p class = story> Then all at once the flame spread out from her hand in lines that traveled throughout the bar like a grid. Fighting heroes were separated from each other and confined by rising walls of fire around them. </p>
  	<p class = story> Then she turned towards Bryan. </p>
  	<p class = story> The telepath had been gazing at the purple flame, but his attention turned towards Lilah. There still wasn’t a trace of anger on her face. She smiled again, a much more mournful smile now.</p>
  	<p class = story> “I never knew you were so powerful, Bry. But you don’t want to use your powers like this, I know you don’t.</p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m sorry. You don’t care to hear it, I’m sure. But I am. And I know it’s not my place to be asking anything else of you, but I need you to stop this, Bryan. Because if you don’t, then I’ll have to stop you. And I don’t really want to do that, you see?”</p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah paused, and Tom could now see conflicting emotions on her face.</p>
  	<p class = story>“So here’s one last selfish request. Can you let them go?”</p>
  <p class = story> Pieces of glasses were strewn across the floor, tables upended, and heroes stood glaring at each other, each silently daring another to make the first move and brave the fire. </p>
  <p class = story> After a moment, Lilah’s eyes widened.</p>
  <p class = story>“You can speak-?” She started, before slumping unconscious across the table. </p>
  <p class = story> The fire around them dissipated. </p>
