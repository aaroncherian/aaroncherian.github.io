  <p class = story> As he opened his eyes, he saw every candle in the bar alight in purple flame. The candles only offered a meager source of fire for Lilah to work with, but those flames swept over every plant in the bar, all of which soon burst into flame as well. Lilah raised her conductor’s wand in short motions and the wicks and stems and leaves burnt into a crisp, reborn in wisps of fire that left behind ashes and stumps of molten wax. It rose into the air, circling around him and Lilah protectively, casting a purple haze over Tom’s vision. There was pain in her eyes, but an anger as well. Not only Bryan’s anger, but a fury of her own. The rest of the bar had erupted into a full brawl at this point, powers flying everywhere, blood staining the furniture, and more than one hero lay unmoving across the floor. Whether her anger was at Bryan, the cause of the riot, herself, or even Tom himself, he wasn’t sure. </p>
	<p class = story>  “Bryan, <i> stop! </i>Take a look at what’s happening around you!” Lilah said, her voice firm, but her hands betrayed her as they trembled in the air. Her flame, however, remained steady. Bryan for the first time looked around him, and then to Lilah, and the anger in his face gave way to pain. He slumped back a little, and Tom could feel the anger weighing him down begin to lift. Bryan held a single hand to Lilah’s face for a moment, and Tom could see something glistening fall down his face. He didn’t know what Bryan told Lilah, but she slumped down across the table, breathing, but unconscious as the fire around them dissipated. </p>
