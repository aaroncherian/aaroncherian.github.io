  <p class = story> Tom looked back to Lilah. </p>
<p class = story> “Help,” he managed to say, although it came out as more of a snarl than a plea. </p>
         <p class = story> Memories of that night with Lilah began to flash through Tom’s mind as Bryan found what he was looking for. And with each passing second he could feel Bryan’s anger intensify along with the pain he was feeling. </p>
   	<p class = story> Panic flooded Tom, blocking out the other emotions that raged within him. There were other things he couldn’t afford to let Bryan see. He glanced towards the other fighting heroes and saw more than one unmoving hero on the ground. </p>
	<p class =  story> Tom lunged out the chair, reaching for Bryan.</p>
	<p class = story>“<i>DO NOT MOVE.</i>” </p>
<p class = story> A foreign voice echoed through his head. It commanded him to obey. He pulled his arms to his side, and there they stayed, his muscles becoming rigid. He futilely willed his uncooperative body to move. Tom’s own expression of shock at Bryan’s sudden outburst of power was mirrored only by the telepath himself, but hatred quickly clouded Bryan’s eyes. </p>
<p class = story> Tom felt the pain begin to return with a vengeance. He closed his eyes in anticipation of the pain. Instead, however, there was warmth. </p>
