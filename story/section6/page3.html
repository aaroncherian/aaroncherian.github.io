  <p class = story> It was affecting Tom’s own mind now, he felt it creeping up, merging with the anger that already existed within him. There was a shift in the air around the bar and Tom could see it affecting the bar as a whole. It was the physical expressions: clenched fists, furrowed brows, raised voices. He felt frustration rise within him, but he couldn’t quite tell whether it was his own or Bryan’s. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Bryan get a grip! Now is not the place!” Tom snapped. Pain exploded in his head, and he shut his eyes to block it out. He could feel it, the strange, agonizing experience of having Bryan dig through his mind for more. The memories flashed through Tom’s mind, and by their connections, Bryan’s too. Memories of late nights on patrol with Lilah. Nights that became later and later. And with each memory the pain intensified. Tom heard himself cry out in pain. </p>
  <p class = story> In the distant background he heard the sound of breaking glass, explosions, and yelling. He opened his eyes, and everything seemed unfocused, but in his periphery he could vaguely make out the forms of people- heroes- fighting each other as Bryan’s anger overwhelmed them, clouding all rational judgement. Lilah was shaking Bryan, shouting something Tom couldn’t quite hear. Bryan pushed her aside as he kept digging through Tom’s mind. Panic flooded him, blocking out the anger. There were other things he couldn’t afford to let Bryan see. He reached out and grabbed Bryan by the collar. </p>
  	<p class = story> <i>“STAY AWAY FROM ME!” </i> A foreign voice echoed through his head, commanding him to obey, and Tom felt his muscles go rigid, and he let go of Bryan and pulled his arms to his side. He sat there, willing his body to move, but found it uncooperative. He stared in shock at Bryan. Bryan stared right back at Tom, and there was only hatred in his eyes. The pain had faded for a brief moment, but Tom could feel it on the edge of his mind, returning with a vengeance. He shut his eyes in anticipation of it, but instead the feeling of warmth and heat surrounded him. </p>
