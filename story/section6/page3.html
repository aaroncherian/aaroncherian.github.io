  <p class = story> Tom looked back to Lilah. </p>
<p class = story> “Help,” he managed to say, although it came out as more of a snarl than a plea. </p>
         <p class = story> Memories of that night with Lilah began to flash through Tom’s mind as Bryan found what he was looking for. And with each passing second he could feel Bryan’s anger intensify along with the pain he was feeling. </p>
   	<p class = story> Panic flooded Tom, blocking out the other emotions that raged within him. There were other things he couldn’t afford to let Bryan see. He glanced towards the fighting heroes. Some were unmoving on the ground. </p>
	<p class =  story> Tom lunged out of the chair. The telepath's eyes widened as Tom reached across the table for him. Tom was just close enough to brush Bryan's jacket when, for the first time, Bryan spoke.</p>
	<p class = story> “<i>STAY BACK.</i>” </p>
<p class = story> The voice was foreign at first as it echoed through his head, but Tom became certain of it a moment later. It was Bryan's voice. He had spoken, not audibly, just in Tom's head, but spoken all the same. And more importantly, the voice commanded Tom to obey.</p>
<p class = story> Against his own will, Tom pushed himself away from Bryan back into the seat. Tom’s own expression of shock at Bryan’s sudden outburst of power was mirrored only by the telepath himself, but hatred quickly clouded Bryan’s eyes. </p>
<p class = story>
   "<i>Do not move.</i>" Bryan said. Tom pulled his arms to his side, and there they stayed. His muscles became rigid as Tom futilely tried to make them move.
</p>
<p class = story> Tom felt Bryan begin to probe his mind again. He shut his eyes in expectation of the pain. Instead, however, Bryan's touch faded as Tom felt a gentle warmth along his skin. </p>
