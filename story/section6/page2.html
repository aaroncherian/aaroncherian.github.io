  <p class = story> The thought had passed through his mind quickly, but Tom had underestimated Bryan’s weariness. Bryan’s control over his powers in his current state was tenuous at best, and nowhere near what he needed to do a firm job of shutting any of their thoughts it.  It only took one moment where Bryan let his defenses down, and one thought from Tom that happened to slip through for Bryan to learn about Tom and Lilah. Tom knew by the way the Bryan’s face changed, eyes widening for a moment, before something even darker came over him. He pushed Lilah’s arm away as anger filled his eyes. </p>

Lilah reacted to it as well, and Tom could tell that she knew as well as he did that Bryan had learned their secret. </p>
	<p class = story> “Oh, Bryan. I’m so sorry, I didn’t want you to find out like this,“ she started, but the anger exploded ten-fold around them. </p>
