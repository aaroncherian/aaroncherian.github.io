<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> All Tom could fully understand at first was pain. A searing agony in his head, and Tom shut his eyes as he attempted to block it out.</p>
  <p class = story> Realization when he opened his eyes, as in his cloudy and unfocused vision he could see Bryan’s staring directly at him, a stare filled with malice. <i>This </i> was the pain of Bryan tearing apart his mind as the telepath dug through it for answers, memory by memory. Lilah was looking at the both of them in alarm. It seemed to Tom like she was speaking to him, but he couldn’t make sense of her words. He cried out as the pain spiked suddenly, and he could see heads around the bar turn towards them.</p>
  	<p class = story> And then he felt the anger. A red-hot fury growing within him. But Tom was familiar with anger, and this was not his own anger. His anger was a steady flow of fire, while this anger was <i>volcanic</i> in nature, powerful and intense. <i>This</i> was Bryan’s anger, anger that stemmed from betrayal and pain. </p>
  	<p class = story> That Bryan could influence the emotions of people around him was not news to Tom. That Bryan could influence them so <i>strongly</i>, however, making Tom experience the telepath's emotions like they were his very own, was news to him. He felt it almost as a tangible force spreading out from Bryan. There was a shift in the atmosphere as heroes around them suddenly clenched their fists, furrowed their brows and raised their voices. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah met Tom’s gaze and Tom could see understanding dawn in her eyes before they too clouded with anger. </p>
    <p class = story> The fighting around the bar began all at once, not from one singular spark, but several. A hero stood up at one corner, and tables shot away from him with explosive force into another group of heroes, who began to unleash their own powers as they recollected themselves. Bright light flared out from a woman at another side of the bar to meet a man rushing towards her, inky darkness flowing out from between his outstretched fingers.</p>
    	<p class = story> Veterans and rookies alike were completely overwhelmed by Bryan’s power, all rational judgement clouded as they began to fight each other indiscriminately.  </p>
