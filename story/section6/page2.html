<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> All Tom could fully understand at first was pain. It was a searing agony in his head that made him shut his eyes in an attempt to block it out. </p>
  <p class = story> Realization struck Tom as he opened his eyes, his vision cloudy and unfocused, and saw Bryan’s hatred-filled stare. <i>This </i> was the pain of his mind being torn apart by Bryan as he dug through Tom’s mind for answers, memory by memory. Lilah was looking at him in alarm. It seemed like she was talking to him, but he couldn’t make sense of her words. He cried out as the pain spiked suddenly, and he could see heads turning around the bar towards their table.</p>
  	<p class = story> And then there was anger. A red-hot fury that Tom could feel growing within him. But this was a different anger than what he was familiar with. Tom’s own anger could be described as a steady flow of fire, a constant presence that was just waiting to be called upon. <i> This </i> anger however, was volcanic in nature, powerful and intense. <i>This</i> was Bryan’s anger, anger that stemmed from betrayal and pain. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom had always known that Bryan could influence emotions of others around him, but he had never <i>how much</i>.  He could feel it almost as a tangible force spreading out from Bryan. There was a shift in the atmosphere as heroes around them suddenly clenched their fists, furrowed their brows and raised their voices. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah met Tom’s gaze and Tom could see realization dawning in her eyes before they too filled with anger. </p>
    <p class = story> The fighting around the bar seemed to start all at once. There wasn’t one spark that started it, but several. Tables shot up into the air with explosive force from one corner as a hero stood up. Bright light exploded out from a woman at one side of the bar, while another man rose up into the air as rapid wind started to pick up around him. </p>
    	<p class = story> Veterans and rookies alike were completely overwhelmed by Bryan’s power, all rational judgement clouded as they began to fight each other indiscriminately.  </p>
