		<h2> Ayano Part II </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Some force pulled Ayano’s struggling body into the air, bringing clumps of snow with her. She briefly found herself face to face with a man standing on the rooftop. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano recognized him immediately from the files her mother had kept, ones she had pored over meticulously before her first patrol. The man was a criminal that had given her mother trouble several times over her career with his gravitational manipulation powers. He even went so far as to give himself a name: Gravitas. </p>
<p class = story> She was pulled even higher, and then the force stopped. She was left suspended above the rooftop. Had her vision not been obscured by the falling snow she might have been able to see well into the rest of the city. </p>
<p class = story> Gravitas looked up at her, </p>
<p class = story> “So you were right. She’s not the real one. The <i>real</i> Scarlet Speedstress would never have been caught so easily.” </p>
<p class = story> Ayano inhaled sharply. The passing of the Scarlet Speedstress mantle had been covered up to avoid unwanted scrutiny from the public. How could he know? </p>
<p class = story> “I told you so, but you refused to believe me,” another voice said from behind her. The voice was quiet and strained. Ayano twisted to the source, an unfamiliar woman who stood at the edge of another rooftop behind her. Her face was gaunt, dark circles under her wide eyes, her jaws clenched. </p>
<p class = story> “Indeed, forgive me. It’s strange, but I had always imagined that I would be the one to take her down. It’s disappointing, quite frankly,” Gravitas said. </p>
<p class = story> “Well get over it. We have a job to do,” the woman practically snarled in her strained voice. </p>
<p class = story> Gravitas made a disappointed <i>tsk</i>. </p>
<p class = story> “So hasty, moments like these are to be savored. Are you her daughter? Sister? Another family relation?” He asked Ayano. She stared down impassively at him in return. </p>
<p class = story> “Chihiro had a daughter,” the woman said casually. “I forget the name, but that’s the most likely option.” </p>
<p class = story> Ayano twisted around to the woman. </p>
<p class = story> <i>She knows Mom’s name. </i></p>
<p class = story> The woman smiled slightly, but her eyes were still cold. </p>
<p class = story> “Ah, yes, the daughter. Obvious give away right there,” she said. </p>
<p class = story> “It’s strange, the streets just seem altogether quieter now,” Gravitas mused. “It’s not the same, knowing she’s not out there.” </p>
<p class = story> “You sir, have a freakishly strange obsession with my mother,” Ayano finally said. “And I can guarantee you it wasn’t a mutual feeling on her part.” </p>
<p class = story> She thought quickly as she spoke, analyzing the situation. One casualty below her. Two hostiles on the roof. </p>
<p class = story> She'd expected to run into Gravitas at some point, or another gravity manipulator at some point. She had a countermeasure prepared, although it was a bit… unorthodox. </p>
<p class = story> “Perhaps it’s time to take up a hobby Gravvy,” she continued. “Crocheting, golfing, cooking. Finding a better name? The list is endless, really.” </p>
<p class = story> The villain glared up at her, anger crossing his face. </p>
<p class = story> All the while, Ayano’s mind raced. An unknown quantity on the roof behind her. But she would have to deal with that later. She reached for the pistol she kept hidden in her belt. Her mother would likely have disproved of her keeping her weapon with her, but Ayano had always found its presence a bit reassuring. And it had its uses. She grazed it with her fingers just as Gravitas spoke.</p>
<p class = story>  “Enough. Disable her.”</p>
<p class = story> An invisible force pressed down on Ayano’s mind. It was a slight pressure that felt strangely similar to what happened when Bryan would make contact with her, and the implication meant her situation was infinitely worse that she had initially thought. </p>
	<p class = story> <i>He brought a telepath. </i>
	<p class = story> An extremely rare power, but one that was perfect to counter hers. </p>
<p class = story> A wave of nausea and dizziness swept over Ayano, and she found herself spinning in the air as she lost her sense of balance. All the while she experienced what she could only describe as her mind fracturing, images, feelings and snippets of memories that forced their way into her mind. Images of her mother, memories of visiting her at the hospital, the heartbreak she felt when her mother looked straight through her with empty eyes. </p>
<p class = story> But they were pale, transparent memories. The telepath was nowhere as strong as Bryan, Ayano realized. That meant she had a chance, all she needed was one moment. </p>
<p class = story> A piece of advice from Lilah sprung to her mind, unbidden. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Sometimes the best opportunity to attack is just as your opponent thinks they’ve won. Strike them when they let their guard down.</i> </p>
<p class = story> Ayano jerked back and let herself go limp, suspended on her back in mid-air while cold snow brushed against her face, as if the attack had overwhelmed her. </p>
<p class = story> A note that Bryan had written her came to mind now. </p>
<p class = story> <i> A good tip for dealing with any enemies, but especially ones like me. Clear your mind, imagine that it’s glass. Smooth, untouchable. Maybe they can see that something’s inside, but they can’t get in. </i>
<p class = story> Ayano flipped over, quickly aimed, and then fired the pistol at Gravitas. The shot clipped him in the shoulder and in her state of suspended gravity, the recoil sent Ayano flying back towards the rooftop where the telepath stood. </p>

<p class = story> She hit the ground, hard, sliding against the cold concrete. </p>
<p class = story> <i>I’ll have some bruises from that. </i></p>
	<p class = story> The mental assault against her started again, but Ayano held fast to Bryan’s words. The intensity dipped, and it became mere background noise. Present, but not rendering her immobile. </p>
	<p class = story> Ayano looked up at the telepath and smiled. </p>
	<p class = story> <i>Sometimes, you just gotta hit ‘em hard and fast. No subtlety needed.</i></p>
	<p class = story> That would be Enzo, of course. </p>
	<p class = story> Ayano did what she did best, she ran. </p>
<p class = story> The world slowed down around her as she moved towards the telepath. She moved in jagged patterns to keep Gravitas from targeting the area around her with his powers. The woman futilely tried to dodge to the side, but from Ayano’s perspective she barely moved at all. Her punch caught the telepath in her gut, and Ayano was sure she heard the sound of ribs cracking as the woman was knocked back a few feet onto the ground. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano was already next to her opponent by the time she was hitting the ground. </p>
<p class = story> Then she saw the flecks of snow begin to rise around her. </p>
<p class = story> <i>Not this time.</i></p>
<p class = story> She pushed herself of the ground and skidded to the side. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano realized belatedly, however, that the telepath had been lifted up into the air, and she was now well out of her reach. </p>
<p class = story> Gravitas made that same disappointed <i>tsk</i> behind her. </p>
<p class = story> "Amateur move, my dear imposter. You’re still untrained. Your mother would have taken that opportunity, rising up with my power, incapacitating her opponent and using the body as a springboard to escape my reach. Efficient, elegant, unlike that crude firearm of yours. You were too afraid of getting caught by my power,” he commented. </p>
<p class = story> It was downright <i>creepy</i> to hear him talk about her mother. Even more so when she realized that he might have been right. </p>
<p class = story> But she wasn’t the one with a bullet to the shoulder. </p>
<p class = story> “Yes, but you’re not like your mother, are you?” The telepath asked. “Your mother would have never wasted time fighting while someone was dying and in need of attention on the ground.” </p>
<p class = story> <i>The man was still alive?</i></p>
<p class = story> The Scarlet Speedstress barely give a second thought to her enemies as she ran back across the rooftop, heat from friction paving a path through the snow behind her. </p>

<p class = story> Through the snow. Across the rooftop. Down the wall. Into the alley. To the body. </p>
<p class = story> She flipped the man over. He was actually much thinner than she had originally believed. His clothes were loose and oversized on him. Her eyes widened as a wisp of fog escaped his mouth. Breath. She mentally tracked a route down to the hospital and reached underneath his body to grab him. </p>
<p class = story> And then he grabbed her arm. </p>
<p class = story> His grip was much stronger than his body had suggested. Ayano looked down at the arm and realized that it was much more muscular than it had been a few moments ago. The man’s entire body changed as he gripped her arm like a vise. His chest expanded outwards, veins bulging along his arms, his muscular frame now tight against the once-oversized clothing. Ayano looked at the shapeshifter’s face as his eye and hair color changed. </p>
<p class = story> She began to push away from him but found the motion impossible, like she was pressing back against a brick wall. Gravitas stood at the edge of the rooftop, a hand clutching his shoulder. Around her, Ayano saw snow compress and flatten around her as gravity pushed down on her, pinning her in place. </p>
<p class = story> The knife felt like a punch to the gut as the shapeshifter drove it into her abdomen. She gasped in pain and shot him. But she was holding the gun at an awkward angle, the bullet only grazed his side. He let go nonetheless and she stumbled back. Ayano took a step to retreat, fighting the restraints of gravity, but her world started to spin as she felt another mental assault on her mind begin. This time, however, she wasn’t in a state to defend herself. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano collapsed onto the cold ground as she lost her sense of balance. Her thoughts were jumbled and scattered, she couldn’t quite think straight anymore.</p>
<p class = story> The shapeshifter walked towards her.</p>
<p class = story> Ayano thought of her mother, who might never remember that she had a daughter.</p>
<p class = story> <i> I’m sorry, in the end I couldn’t even compare to the kind of hero you were.</i></p>
<p class = story> The man yanked her head up and held the knife up to her throat. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano thought of Bryan, Lilah, Enzo and Tom. </p>
<p class = story> <i> I did everything you guys said. All of it. So why-</i></p>
<p class = story> He brought the knife across her neck and let her head drop to the ground. </p>
<p class = story> As Ayano lay dying in the snow, she couldn’t help but wish for one more chance to live</p>
<p class = story> <i> I can do better</i>, she pleaded to the nothingness that was obscuring her thoughts and vision. <i>One more chance and I’ll do better</i>. </p>
<p class = story> Above all else, she wished that someone would come to save her. </p>
<p class = story> She died alone. </p>
