		<h2> Ayano II </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Some force pulled her struggling body into the air, powdery flecks of snow drifting upwards as well. She briefly found herself face to face with a man standing on the rooftop. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano recognized him immediately from the files her mother had kept, ones that Ayano had pored over meticulously before going on her first patrol. The man was a criminal that had given her mother trouble several times over her career with his gravitational manipulation powers. He even went so far as to give himself a name: Gravitas. </p>
<p class = story> She was pulled even higher, until she was left dangling up above the rooftop. Had her vision not been obscured by the falling snow she might have been able to see well into the rest of the city. </p>
<p class = story> He looked up at her, </p>
<p class = story> “So you were right. She’s not the <i>real</i> one.” </p>
<p class = story> Ayano inhaled sharply. The passing of the Scarlet Speedstress mantle had been covered up to avoid unwanted scrutiny from the public. How did he know? </p>
<p class = story> “I told you so. The <i>real</i> would never have been caught so easily,” another voice said from behind her. The voice was quiet and strained. Ayano twisted to the source, an unfamiliar woman who stood at the edge of another rooftop. Her face was gaunt, dark circles under her wide eyes, her jaws clenched. </p>
<p class = story> “Indeed. That’s disappointing, quite frankly.” </p>
<p class = story> An invisible force pressed down on Ayano’s mind. It was a slight pressure that felt strangely similar to what happened when Bryan would make contact with her, and the implication meant her situation was infinitely worse that she had initially thought. </p>
<p class = story> “Ah, so you’re Chihiro’s daughter, it makes sense that they would bring you in,” the woman said, and there was an undertone of resentment to the sentence. </p>
<p class = story> She immediately began to clear her mind of thoughts, a trick she had practiced with Bryan many times. The pressure disappeared, and the woman frowned. Ayano smiled just a bit, her power was nothing compared to Bryan’s. </p>
<p class = story> Regardless, a telepath was scarce as it was, and dealing with one was no small matter. The woman had already found her and her mother’s own identity in a matter of seconds. They had expected her, baited her, and anticipated her moves. A man was dead on the frozen ground beneath them because of her. She took a deep breath and watched as it escaped in a frosty mist as she analyzed the situation. </p>
<p class = story> One casualty below her. </p>
<p class = story> Two culprits that she could see around her. One with powers she knew the specifics of. </p>
<p class = story>  Another that was an unknown quantity. </p>
<p class = story> They should have brought more people. </p>
	<p class = story> “What do you want from me?” Ayano asked calmly while reaching for the pistol she kept hidden in her belt. Her mother would likely have disproved of her keeping her weapon with her, but Ayano had always found its presence a bit reassuring. And it had its uses. </p>
<p class = story> The woman laughed softly, </p>
	<p class = story> “There’s nothing you can give us. You will die here tonight Ayano,” she continued. “And I really am sorry, you deserved better than this. But I was made a bargain, and I intend to fulfill my side of it.” </p>
	<p class = story> “<i>Enough</i>,” Gravitas cut in. “Disable her.” </p>
	<p class = story> A wave of nausea and dizziness swept over Ayano, and she found herself spinning in the air as she lost her sense of balance. All the while she experienced what she could only describe as her mind <i>fracturing</i>, images, feelings and snippets of memories that forced their way into her mind. Images of her mother, memories of visiting her at the hospital, the heartbreak she felt when her mother looked straight through her with those empty eyes. </p>
	<p class = story> But they were pale, transparent memories that she could see through. The telepath was nowhere as strong as Bryan, and Ayano still had control of her body. All it would take was one moment. </p>
<p class = story> She jerked back and let herself go limp, suspended on her back in mid-air as cold snow brushed against her face. The mental assault paused for a moment and that was all she needed. </p>
	<p class = story> Ayano flipped over, quickly aimed, and then fired the pistol at Gravitas. The shot clipped him in the shoulder and in her state of suspended gravity, the recoil sent Ayano flying back towards the rooftop where the telepath stood. </p>
	<p class = story> She hit the ground, hard, sliding against the cold concrete. She’d would definitely some bruises to show for that, but Ayano got up quickly, and did what she did best. She ran. </p>
	<p class = story> The world slowed down around her as she moved towards the telepath. She moved in jagged patterns to keep Gravitas from targeting the area around her with his powers. The woman futilely tried to dodge to the side, but from Ayano’s perspective she barely moved at all. Her punch caught the telepath in her gut, and Ayano was sure she heard the sound of ribs cracking as the telepath was knocked back a few feet onto the ground. </p>
	<p class = story> Ayano was already next to the woman by the time she was hitting the ground. Out of the corner of her eyes she saw flecks of snow start rising into the air. She pushed herself of the ground and skidded to the side. Not a moment later the telepath rose into the air and well out of Ayano’s reach. There was a moment’s pause. </p>
	<p class = story> “Better than I expected,” Ayano heard Gravitas say behind her. </p>
<p class = story> The woman looked down. </p>
	<p class = story> “Indeed,” she said. “Although her mother would have never wasted time fighting while someone was dying on the ground.” </p>
	<p class = story> <i>The man was still alive?</i></p>
	<p class = story> The Scarlet Speedstress barely give a second thought to her situation as she ran back across the rooftop. Heat generated by friction paved a path behind her. </p>
<p class = story> Through the snow. Across the rooftop. Down the wall. Into the alley. To the body. </p>
	<p class = story> She flipped the man over. He was actually much thinner than she had originally believed. His clothes were loose and oversized on him. Her eyes widened as a wisp of fog escaped his mouth. She mentally tracked a route down to the hospital and reached underneath his body to grab him. </p>
	<p class = story> And then he grabbed her arm. </p>
<p class = story> His grip was much stronger than his body would suggest. Ayano looked down at the arm and realized that it was much more muscular than a few moments ago, filling up the clothes that he wore. The man’s entire body changed as his grip clamped on her arm like a vise. Ayano looked at the man’s face as his features changed, his eye and hair color changing. </p>
<p class = story>  She began to push back away from the shapeshifter but found the motion impossible, like she was pushing back against a brick wall. Gravitas stood at the edge of the rooftop, a hand clutching his shoulder. Around her, Ayano saw snow compress and flatten around her. </p>
	<p class = story> The knife felt like a punch to the gut as the man holding her drove it into her abdomen. She gasped in pain and pulled away. He let go of her and the pressure holding her down disappeared. Ayano took a step to retreat, but her world started to spin again as she felt another mental assault on her mind begin. This time, however, she was in much less of a state to resist. </p>
<p class = story>  Ayano collapsed onto the cold ground as she lost her sense of balance. The air suddenly started to push down on her again, forcing her to stay on the ground. Her thoughts were jumbled and scattered, she couldn’t quite think straight anymore. </p>
	<p class = story> The shapeshifter walked towards her. </p>
	<p class = story> Ayano thought of her mother, who might never remember that she had a daughter. </p>
	<p class = story> He yanked her head up and held the knife up to her throat. </p>
	<p class = story> Ayano thought of Bryan, Lilah, Enzo and Tom. </p>
	<p class = story> He brought the knife across her neck. </p>
	<p class = story> And as Ayano lay dying in the snow, she couldn’t help but wish for one more chance to live. To do better.  </p>
	<p class = story> She wished that someone would come to save her.   </p>
