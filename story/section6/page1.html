  <p class = story>“It was the fall after she died,” Lilah explained, apparently unaffected by the same restrictions on speech Tom was in a memory. “We had just caught Ayano’s killer, a man named Gravitas. He was an old enemy of her mother’s. Someone with a vendetta. We found him, brought him in, and you convinced Enzo to join Shard on that job downtown.” </p>
<p class = story> She said no more, instead closing her eyes, and the memory around them resumed, time unfrozen as if she had pressed the play button on a remote. </p>
<p class = story> “To the Scarlet Speedstress!” Lilah exclaimed, raising a glass. The two of them did the same. They were all in high spirits that night.  </p>
<p class = story> Bryan made a point of raising his glass specifically in Tom’s direction. </p>
<p class = story> “He’s right Tom,” Lilah said, smiling more than Tom had seen in a long time. “We wouldn’t have caught him if you hadn’t acted on that hunch of yours, looking at the first Scarlet Speedstress’ enemies.” Tom smiled in return, </p>
<p class = story> “It was luck mostly that I even remembered to think of him. I just happened to remembered that Chihiro always complained about one gravity-manipulating felon in particular that always gave her a hard time,” he said, waving off the compliment.  </p>
<p class = story> “Well I’m glad it panned out,” Lilah said. “It’s strange, you know, after all this time we spent looking into it, it’s a weird sense of freedom. It sounds terrible, yeah, I know, but I finally feel like we can get back to the job now. The job she would have wanted us to be doing.” She put a hand on Bryan’s arm, </p>
<p class = story> “And now you can take a break too,” she continued. If Bryan had looked exhausted before, he looked absolutely haggard now, having worked overtime and beyond the past few weeks to hunt down Ayano’s killer. He smiled slightly and dipped his head, and put a hand over hers. </p>
<p class = story> “I heard from Enzo too yesterday. It really does sound like he’s been doing well,” Tom added. “He’s tired too for sure, but it’s the best that I’ve heard him sound in a long time.” </p>
<p class = story> Bryan and Lilah smiled in response, taking another sip of their drinks. They all sat around in silence, taking in the moment.  Tom’s gaze idly flicked towards Lilah, and for the smallest fraction of a second, he thought back to one night many months ago. The first night, when he had first realized how he really felt- </p>
<p class = story> His world shattered. </p>
