  <p class = story> “<a href = "scarletII.html"> To the Scarlet Speedstress!</a>” Lilah exclaimed, raising a glass. Bryan and Tom did the same.</p>
  <p class = story>Bryan made a point of raising his glass specifically in Tom’s direction. </p>
<p class = story>“He’s right Tom,” Lilah said with a wide smile. “We owe this one to you. You’re the one who thought to consider Chihiro’s old foes as suspects.” </p>
<p class = story>Tom allowed himself a small smile. </p>
<p class = story> “It was nothing but luck, really. Just a hunch that I should have acted on much sooner,” he replied, waving off the compliment. </p>
<p class = story> “It wasn’t luck, it was brilliant thinking on your part,” Lilah stated firmly. “Although it’s strange, you know, after all this time we spent looking into finding Ayano’s killer…I just have the weirdest sense of freedom. I know, it sounds terrible. But I’m glad we can get back to the job now. We make much better heroes than hunters.” </p>
<p class = story>She then placed a hand on Bryan’s arm, </p>
<p class = story> “And <i>you</i>, you are going to be taking a very extended vacation. Does that sound good?” Lilah asked, her tone indicating that it was really no question at all. </p>
<p class = story> Bryan nodded meekly. The demands of past months seemed to have settled as a permanent weariness in his expression. </p>
<p class = story> “I heard from Enzo too yesterday,” Tom added. “He’s tired, and according to him the constant stakeouts that Shard has them on aren’t good for his complexion.” </p>
<p class = story> Bryan smirked. </p>
<p class = story> “So he’s doing well enough to complain, then,” Lilah said dryly. “That’s good, you must be happy he’s doing better.” </p>
<p class = story> “I was worried about him for a bit,” Tom admitted. </p>
<p class = story> The conversation faded into a natural lull, and the group sat in silence. Tom’s gaze idly flicked towards Lilah, and for just a moment he thought back to that one night they had been on patrol together, just after Ayano had died. The one night when she had asked him to come home with her. </p>
<p class = story>It was only a few hours later, when Tom looked back on those last few moments of peace that he would realize how it had gone so horribly wrong. </p>
<p class = story>It was a number of things really. The feeling Tom had upon seeing Lilah so joyful, and one moment where he allowed himself to hope for what he knew could not be. </p>
<p class = story>And that one moment happened to coincide with the one moment that Bryan, in his weariness, let his guard down, relaxing the restrictions he placed on his own power. A moment where an entirely wrong thought came to pass, and the entirely wrong person was there to hear it. </p>
<p class = story>Tom would look back on the night more than once, wondering what might have happened if Bryan hadn’t been so exhausted that night, if he hadn’t found out about the affair the way he did. Perhaps Lilah would have told him the truth on her own terms at a later date.</p>
<p class = story>Unfortunately for all of them, that was not how Bryan learned of it. </p>
<p class = story>Tom sat through the next few moments blissfully unaware of the storm that was coming for him.</p>
<p class = story>And then his world shattered.</p>
