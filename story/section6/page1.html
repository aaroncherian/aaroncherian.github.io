<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> “<a href = "scarletII.html"> To the Scarlet Speedstress!</a>” Lilah exclaimed, raising a glass. Bryan and Tom did the same.</p>
  	<p class = story>  Bryan made a point of raising his glass specifically in Tom’s direction. </p>
  	<p class = story> “He’s right Tom,” Lilah said, smiling more than Tom had seen in a long time. ““We wouldn’t have caught him if you hadn’t acted on that hunch of yours and tracked down some of the first Scarlet Speedstress’ enemies.” </p>
   <p class = story> Tom smiled in return, </p>
  	<p class = story> “It was luck mostly, that I even remembered to think of him. I just happened to remember that Chihiro always complained about one gravity-manipulating felon in particular that always gave her a hard time,” he said, waving off the compliment.  </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m glad it panned out,” Lilah said. “It’s strange, you know, after all this time we spent looking into it, it’s a weird sense of freedom. It sounds terrible, yeah, I know, but I finally feel like we can get back to the job now. The job she would have wanted us to be doing.” </p>
   <p class = story> She put a hand on Bryan’s arm, </p>
  	<p class = story> “And as for you, you are going to be taking a very extended vacation. Does that sound good?” She continued, although it was evident to both men at the table that Bryan had no choice in the matter. </p>
  <p class = story> The weariness Bryan had been experiencing for the months seemed to have settled as a permanent part of his facial expression over the past few weeks in which he worked overtime and beyond to hunt down Ayano’s killer. All the same he smiled slightly and put a hand over hers. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I heard from Enzo too yesterday. It really does sound like he’s been doing well,” Tom added. “He’s tired too for sure, but it’s the best that I’ve heard him sound in a long time.” </p>
  	<p class = story> They sat in silence as the conversation died down naturally.  Tom’s gaze idly flicked towards Lilah, and for just a moment he thought back to that one night they had been on patrol together. The one night she had asked him to come home with her. </p>
  <p class = story> Perhaps, if Bryan had not been so exhausted that one thought could have passed unnoticed. And perhaps then Lilah would have been able to tell Bryan the truth on her own terms at a later time. </p>
  <p class = story> Unfortunately for all of them that was not how Bryan learned of the affair. He learned, when in his weariness he let his guard down. One moment where he allowed himself to relax. One moment where he heard the thoughts of every mind in his vicinity, even the ones he usually took great care not to listen to. One moment when he realized that the two people at his table had been keeping a secret from him for months. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom sat through the next few moments blissfully unaware of the storm that was coming for him. </p>
  	<p class = story> And then his world shattered. </p>
