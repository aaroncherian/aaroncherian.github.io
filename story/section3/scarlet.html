		<h2> Ayano Part I</h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> <i> Deep breaths</i> </p>
<p class = story> A single body in an alleyway.</p>
<p class = story> <i> Stay calm</i> </p>
<p class = story> Blood was pooling into the crystalline snow around him. Him. A male body. </p>
<p class = story> <i> Stay collected</i> </p>
<p class = story> A large man, as best she could tell. Too large for her to carry directly to the hospital. Possibly too injured for that kind of transport as well. </p>
<p class = story> Dark shadows covered the alleyway. She couldn’t tell whether he was breathing. </p>
<p class = story> <i> There’s too much blood</i> </p>
<p class = story> She had been too late. </p>
               <p class = story> Ayano stood just outside the narrow passageway between the remains of a convenience market and electronics store, judging the situation as best she could. His clothes, from a distance, seemed slightly ragged. There was nothing about him that suggested he was worth robbing. </p>
<p class = story> <i>  A killing out of cold blood? </i> </p>
<p class = story> She frowned, wondering why anyone would be walking around the area in the first place. </p>
<p class = story> Looking down the avenue, she saw a large marble wall in the distance. It towered over burnt complexes and charred houses. She could make out the vague forms of those ruins in the distance, the Scorched Streets. The pale white wall stood in stark contrast to the black remains behind it. </p>
<p class = story> The wall served a double purpose. On the one hand, it was a memorial. The names of the 958 innocent people that had died on that night so long ago were inscribed into the wall. On the other hand, it marked that part of the city off, separating it from the rest. </p>
<p class = story> Once, it had been a residential neighborhood. Now it was a blight on their city. The surrounding few blocks, even though they had been untouched by the fire, had been abandoned by most. It was too close to painful memories. Which left a single question. </p>
<p class = story> <i> Why was this man walking around here? </i> </p>
<p class = story>Ayano observed again, and thought. What would Tom tell her to do? </p>
<p class = story> <i> When your shift is done, it’s not your job to take any calls. Leave it to the other heroes on patrol. </i> </p>
<p class = story> His last words to her echoed through her mind. </p>
<p class = story> She clenched her gloved fists tightly. </p>
<p class = story> No, she needed to think of what the Tom she had first met would say. The Tom, that, when she had first taken over the mantle of the Scarlet Speedstress, had offered her a spot on his own patrol without hesitation. Tom, before the commission system had been implemented. Before he had been swept up like so many other heroes, scrambling to bring in as many criminals as possible to fatten their paychecks a bit. Before he had grown cold and distant, but prone of outbursts of anger. </p>
<p class = story> <i> Some of us have been given great power, and others less so. Whatever the case, use it. Do what you can. </i> </p>
<p class = story>That’s what <i>that</i> Tom would have advised her to do. </p>
<p class = story>She would do what she could. Help the man if possible, and canvass the area for his attacker otherwise. She would show Tom that they couldn’t afford to live under the restrictions of the system. </p>
<p class = story>Ayano stepped into the alleyway, her foot pressing down into the snow. A tentative step, not yet using her speed. The crunch of her boots made her stop as something occurred to her. </p>
<p class = story> <i> Why were there no footprints around the body? </i> </p>
<p class = story> The snow was smooth, with mounds here and there, but nothing that would suggest an attacker running away from the body. </p>
<p class = story>It took her a brief moment before she noticed that strangely, the snow had started to rise upwards in the air. </p>
<p class = story>Ayano realized she might be in trouble when she felt herself be pulled up into the frigid air. </p>
