		<h2> Ayano I</h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> A man lay face down inside the alleyway, blood pooling into the crystalline snow around him. Ayano stood just outside the narrow passageway between the remains of a convenience market and electronics store. </p>
<p class = story> The victim was a large man as best she could tell, possibly too large for her to carry directly to the hospital. Dark shadows covered the alleyway, making it difficult for Ayano to tell whether he was still breathing. If she were to judge just based on the amount of blood however, she was too late. His clothes seemed slightly ragged from a distance. There was nothing about him that suggested he was worth robbing. Killing out of cold blood? </p>
<p class = story> She frowned, wondering why anyone would be walking around out here in the first place. It was a part of the city abandoned for the most part due to its proximity to the Scorched Streets. </p>
<p class = story> If Ayano were to look down the avenue, she would have seen a large marble wall in the distance. It marked off a part of the city that had been termed the Scorched Streets, separating it from the rest. Written on the wall she knew, even though she was much too far to see it, were the names of the 958 civilians that had died in there. Even in the dark she could make out the charred remains of buildings peeking up over the wall.  Although once that area had been a residential neighborhood, it was now a blight on their city. For most residents, those streets were nothing but a reminder of painful memories, leaving even the area around them abandoned.  So why had this man gone walking around here? And why was he left dead in an alleyway? </p>
<p class = story> <i>When your shift is done, it’s not your job to take any calls. Leave it to the other heroes on patrol. </i></p>
<p class = story> Ayano clenched her gloved fists tightly. </p>
<p class = story>  When she had first taken over the mantle of the Scarlet Speedstress, she had appreciated Tom’s guidance. At their first meeting, he seemed like the man that her mother had described: a hero that gladly accepted individuals deemed dangerous because of their powers, offering them a spot in his own patrol without hesitation. Over the months that she’d been a part of his patrol, however, she saw his mannerisms shift. He grew colder, more prone to outbursts of anger. </p>
<p class = story>  She attributed part of that shift to the implementation of the commission system. It had started soon after she’d first gone on patrol. She had seen how other heroes frantically scrambled to bring in as many criminals as possible just to fatten their paychecks a bit. She despised the system for what she had seen it do to other heroes, how it brought out their selfishness, and if anything, she was disappointed that Tom was no exception to the rule. </p>
<p class = story> But that’s why she would press onward, refusing to give into the system to show them all, to show Tom that there was a better way. </p>
<p class = story> And so she stepped into the alleyway, her foot pressing down into the snow. The <i>crunch</i> of her boots made her stop as something occurred to her. Why were there no footprints around the body? The snow was smooth, with mounds here and there, but nothing that would suggest an attacker running <i>away</i> from the body. </p>
<p class = story> It took her a brief moment before she noticed that strangely, the snow had started to rise <i>upwards</i> in the air. </p>
<p class = story> Ayano realized she might be in trouble when she felt her boots lose contact with the ground.</p>
