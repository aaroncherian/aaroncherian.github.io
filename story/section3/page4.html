  	<p class = story> Tom tried to interject, but found his facial muscles unresponsive, his own tongue frozen in his mouth. </p>
  <p class = story> He felt the cold this time like a frigid wind blowing over him. He struggled, even though he knew it was futile. He needed to talk to Lilah, to Enzo. Even a one-sided conversation with Bryan would be preferable to living through another memory. </p>
  	<p class = story> He blinked, and the bar was empty, the teammates he knew vanished from sight. </p>
  	<p class = story> A second time and he was back in costume again. Dusty dim lightbulbs suddenly became clean and bright. </p>
  	<p class = story> He blinked a third. There was a numbness as he lost any remaining control over his body.</p>
  	<p class = story> Tom thought back to the past, but everything past the night Ayano died was still a haze.</p>
  	<p class = story> <i>Fine</i>, he decided. <i>Show me a memory with an answer this time, and I'll play along with whatever this is. </i> </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom blinked, although seeing as he couldnâ€™t even do such a small action of his own volition, it would be more accurate to say that his body blinked and opened his eyes to another memory. </p>
