<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Tom turned his attention towards the others, where Bryan, Enzo, and Lilah seemed unaware of what had just occurred. He frowned, Ayano’s seat was empty. Where had she gone? </p>
  <p class = story> Enzo looked over at him. </p>
  	<p class = story>“We’re making the toast,” he said, taking one of four glasses that must have arrived while Tom was otherwise distracted. </p>
  <p class = story> A toast? Odd that they weren’t waiting for Ayano to come back. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom picked up a glass nevertheless. </p>
  	<p class = story> “To a reunion a long time coming.” Lilah said. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom looked over to where Ayano had been sitting again, realizing her coat was gone as well. When had she left? </p>
  <p class = story> “And to those who couldn’t be here with us tonight,” Enzo said, choking up slightly. </p>
  <p class = story> Something in Tom’s head started pounding, and he winced at the pain slightly. </p>
  	<p class = story> “To Ayano, our Scarlet Speedstress. We miss you.” </p>
  <p class = story> Perhaps a touch overemotional, Tom mused, considering Ayano had been there for most of the night, but also perfectly within Enzo’s tendency towards over-exaggeration. </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah and Bryan raised their glasses. </p>
  <p class = story> “Seven years to the day,” Lilah said. “You served our city well.” </p>
