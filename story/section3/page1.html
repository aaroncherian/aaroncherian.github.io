<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Tom turned his attention towards the others at the table. Bryan, Enzo and Lilah sat in conversation, apparently none-the-wiser to what he had just experienced. The space next to Lilah was empty. Where had Ayano gone off to? </p>
 <p class = story> Enzo looked over at him.</p>
	<p class = story> “I thought you had dozed off there for a moment Tom. Grab a glass, we’re about to make the toast,” he said, taking one of the four glasses that were now on the table. </p>
	<p class = story> It was odd that they weren’t waiting for Ayano to return before making it, but Tom picked up a glass nevertheless. </p>
	<p class = story> “To a reunion a long time coming.” Lilah said. </p>
	<p class = story> Tom looked over to again to the empty space next to Lilah. He frowned, noting that Ayano’s coat had disappeared as well. Enzo started to speak, but then stopped. Lilah reached out and put her hand on his arm. </p>
<p class = story> “And to those who couldn’t be here with us tonight,” Enzo said, choking up slightly. “To Ayano, our Scarlet Speedstress. We miss you kid.” </p>
<p class = story> The toast was perhaps a touch overemotional given that Ayano had been there for most of the night, Tom mused. But it was Enzo after all, and he tended towards over-exaggeration whenever possible. </p>
<p class = story> Lilah and Bryan raised their glasses. </p>
<p class = story> “Seven years to the day,” Lilah said. “Ayano, we thank you for your service to this city.” </p>
