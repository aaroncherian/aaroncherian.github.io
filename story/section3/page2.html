<p class = story> The meaning of her words took a few moments to register completely for Tom. He realized that Enzo had started talking again. </p>
	<p class = story>  “I just keep thinking that if we had stopped her from leaving that night, she would still be alive.” </p>
<p class = story> Something at Tom’s core grew cold, and the pounding in his head increased tenfold. </p>
	<p class = story> “Come on Enzo, we’ve been through this, nothing could have stopped Ayano from going where someone was in need. We … I … someone should’ve gone with her instead, maybe she would still be here,” Lilah said. “But why would we ever think she would need back up? She was the fastest woman in the city, and we thought it was just a simple mugging. Who ever thought anyone could touch her, let alone kill her?” </p>
	<p class = story>  <i> Kill her. </i> </p>
	<p class = story> The memory slammed through him like a thunderbolt, and the rest of that night came back to him. The Scarlet Speedstress had indeed died that night taking that last call. Trapped and murdered in an alleyway. How could he have forgotten? How could he have let himself belief that she had been alive, and with them just a few minutes ago? </p>
	<p class = story>  Tom tried to speak, but everything started spinning around him again. </p>
