  <p class = story> “You won’t leave here alive,” Tom said softly. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I know.”</p>
  	<p class = story> “You’ve singlehandedly <a href = 'city.html'>sentenced this city to death</a> without its heroes. Everyone will panic, the police will be overwhelmed, and soon crime will grow unchecked, and every innocent in this city will pay. Everyone will remember you for this, and they will hate you.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “I know, Tom.” Lilah looked at him, and there was a small, but genuine smile on her face. “But that’s the beauty of it. Out of these ashes they’ll rise, ordinary civilians that will use the powers they’ve been keeping hidden to help others. To protect this city. They’ll become heroes, not because it’s their job, but because it’s who they are. Just like Ayano was.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom shook his head sadly. </p>
  	<p class = story> “They won’t last a minute out there. There’s more to being a hero than just good intentions, Lilah.” He said. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom paused for a moment, and looked back at the charred corpse in front of him, and had to fight back the urge to gag as the stench of burnt corpses reached him. He looked at Lilah, and for a moment, Tom saw the Lilah that he once knew, who would laugh and tease him endlessly, but still be the first to realize when something was amiss. That Lilah soon faded away, replaced by the ghost that stood before him. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I thank you for your service to this city,” Tom whispered. </p>
