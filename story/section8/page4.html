  <p class = story> “Lilah,<i> what are you doing?!</i>” He shouted. “You’re killing them all!”  Lilah broke eye contact with Tom, looked towards Enzo, and shrugged. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Everyone here deserves death. They’re all guilty. They’re all guilty for helping hunt down Bryan, for leaving him to <i>die</i>. Speaking of which, Lorenzo, you’re as guilty as all the rest, aren’t you?” Fire rose into the air in Enzo’s direction. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I don’t want to hurt you Lilah. This isn’t you,” Enzo said softly. “You’re letting your powers get the better of you, you need to take control!” The flames heading in his direction seemed to freeze in midair, and Lilah began to laugh.</p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m the one who needs to control my powers? Oh Lorenzo, I’m in perfect control. You’re the one who can’t control his powers. Don’t pretend otherwise, we <i>all</i> knew. You were always just barely keeping your powers under control. I never lost control of any of my flames. Ayano could always control her speed. And Bryan? He kept his power under control for years, making sure he didn’t read our minds. But you, you couldn’t even keep a measly spark contained, much less interfere with the electricity around us.”</p>
  	<p class = story> The electricity became brighter, and the lights started to flicker.</p>
  	<p class = story> “I have control,” Enzo said through gritted teeth. “I…have…control.”</p>
  <p class = story> The lamps around them went dark, and more sparks of electricity traveled along the walls and floors and up Enzo’s body, dancing around it. Lilah’s laughter seemed to double.</p>
  	<p class = story> “Control?” She exclaimed. “You can barely keep yourself together right now! How long before you lose control again and drain power from part of an entire city again?” </p>
  	<p class = story> Enzo froze, and Tom’s own eyes widened. </p>
  	<p class = story>  “See Tom, I did a bit of digging while I was gone,” Lilah said, a hint of smugness in her voice. “I finally know where you two met. You didn’t have control then, Lorenzo, and you don’t have any now.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom still remembered, it had been another city, another time, long before he had risen to lead a team. He remembered walking through streets that had gone entirely dark, following arcs of electricity as they lead all the way to one man, who lay curled in an alleyway, electricity flinging wildly around him as his powers ran rampant, slowly draining a city of its power. </p>
  	<p class = story> “An entire quarter of a city gone dark,” Lilah taunted. “Not just the lights, but <i>everything</i>. There was a hospital there too right? How many people do you think died because you lost control, Lorenzo? That’s why you follow Tom so blindly. He offered to teach you control, and you latched on to him.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Enzo was silent for a moment before turning his head slightly towards Tom, still keeping Lilah within his sight. Tom only had to catch a glimpse of the resigned expression on his face before realizing what was about to happen. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m so sorry Tom,” Enzo whispered. </p>
  	<p class = story>  <i> “No!” </i> Tom reached out for him, but Enzo suddenly arched back, and the entire bar was plunged into darkness. </p>
