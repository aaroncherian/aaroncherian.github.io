  	<p class = story> Enzo froze, and Tom’s own eyes widened. </p>
  	<p class = story>  “See Tom, I did a bit of digging while I was gone,” Lilah said, a hint of smugness in her voice. “I finally know where you two met. You didn’t have control then, Lorenzo, and you don’t have any now.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom still remembered, it had been another city, another time, long before he had risen to lead a team. He remembered walking through streets that had gone entirely dark, following arcs of electricity as they lead all the way to one man, who lay curled in an alleyway, electricity flinging wildly around him as his powers ran rampant, slowly draining a city of its power. </p>
  	<p class = story> “An entire quarter of a city gone dark,” Lilah taunted. “Not just the lights, but <i>everything</i>. There was a hospital there too right? How many people do you think died because you lost control, Lorenzo? That’s why you follow Tom so blindly. He offered to teach you control, and you latched on to him.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Enzo was silent for a moment before turning his head slightly towards Tom, still keeping Lilah within his sight. Tom only had to catch a glimpse of the resigned expression on his face before realizing what was about to happen. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m so sorry Tom,” Enzo whispered. </p>
  	<p class = story>  <i> “No!” </i> Tom reached out for him, but Enzo suddenly arched back, and the entire bar was plunged into darkness. </p>
