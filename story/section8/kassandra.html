		<h2>Kassandra </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Kassandra walked quickly through the street, completely aware that she was being trailed. Her instincts as a former hero hadn’t left her completely and her powers, even if they were significantly weaker than they had been a year ago, helped with that as well. </p>
  	<p class = story> Unfortunately for her follower, she wasn’t the kind of person to run. Let them come for her if they wanted. </p>
  	<p class = story>Even in her weakened state, she would still know when anyone entered her vicinity. </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra turned a corner into an empty alleyway. She was already in an emptier portion of the city. Here, she could deal with her mysterious follower without being interrupted. Soon enough, she felt it, someone’s mind as they walked into her short range of power. </p>
  	<p class = story>And then the fire came. </p>
  <p class = story>Kassandra stepped back as the flame swept through the alleyway, violet flame that moved unnaturally and formed a circle around her. While physically she felt the heat of the fire on her skin, inside Kassandra felt cold as ice.
  	<p class = story><p class = story>She knew this flame. Almost every hero did. </p>
  	<p class = story>Lilah stepped into the alleyway just a moment later. Kassandra tried, as she always did, to probe her mind, but the fire-starter’s mind was a polished stone, completely smooth with no cracks for Kassandra to penetrate. A year ago, she might have had the power, but now such a task was beyond her reach. </p>
  	<p class = story>It wasn’t wholly unexpected however, the woman had been close to the other telepath, Sanctum. It only made sense she had learned how to hide her mind away. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Let’s have a conversation, you and I,” Lilah said. Her expression was completely neutral, her hands at her sides, loosely holding a conductors baton in her hand. </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra’s gaze narrowed on the object. She always carried it with her, and from her time as a hero she had heard that the woman needed the object to use her powers. It was rare, but it wasn’t unheard of for a hero’s power to be connected to a specific object. </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra dipped her head, all the while further probing her opponent’s mind. </p>
  	<p class = story> “By all means,” she said. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’m going to ask you a simple question, and I’d like an honest answer,” Lilah said. “And then we can both leave here.” </p>
  	<p class = story>The woman’s mind was a damn fortress. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Go ahead,” Kassandra replied. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Were you there the night the Scarlet Speedstress was murdered in an alleyway?” </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra tried to keep her expression neutral, but for a brief moment she slipped, a mix of shock and anger appearing on her face. </p>
  	<p class = story>She knew it, and Lilah did too. The flames suddenly to twice their current height. </p>
  	<p class = story> “How?” Kassandra asked. There was no use in trying to lie about it. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I kept thinking to myself, how could Ayano have been killed that night? Sure, she was less experienced, but not even Gravitas should have been able to kill her so easily,” Lilah said, her voice controlled, not betraying any emotion. “And then when we were going through Ayano’s belongings I found Chihiro’s old case files. I read up on Gravitas, and I realized every time he had bested Chihiro, he had been supported by others with powers.” </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra frowned, as she hit a bump in her probing of Lilah’s mind. A part that wasn’t as smooth and untouchable as the rest. </p>
  	<p class = story> “And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it didn’t make sense for Gravitas to have been working alone that night. So I decided I would start exploring other options, and I looked at people who had a personal connection to the Scarlet Speedstress,” Lilah continued. </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra realized what she was feeling in Lilah’s mind. A pathway. The work of another telepath. Someone else had broken into her mind, crudely it seemed, ripping right through it. The mind was a fragile thing, and while it seemed Lilah was slowly recovering, the scars were still clear. Whoever it was had broken straight through Lilah’s mental shields and left a hole, a hole that Kassandra could follow straight through into her mind. She tuned back to what Lilah was saying.  </p>
   <p class = story> “And who better than you, Kassandra? The woman who was essentially responsible for the retirement of the first Scarlet Speedstress. You, the hero that was cast out in shame by all the rest, the name Sensory scribbled away.” </p>
  	<p class = story> Kassandra suddenly felt a sudden surge of anger at Lilah’s words. </p>
  	<p class = story> “It was a mistake!” She yelled out, surprised by her own outburst. “I made a single mistake and then they threw me away like I was nothing! You don’t think I’ve regretted what I’ve done every day? You don’t think I see Chihiro’s memories in my mind? That I don’t realize I took away one of the greatest heroes this city has known?” </p>
  	<p class = story> “<i>Then why did you help kill Ayano?</i>” Lilah asked, her anger surfacing for the first time in their conversation. Kassandra paused for a few moments. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Because they promised to take me back,” she whispered. “They said if I did this for them, that they would set me up elsewhere, in another city. That I could be a hero again. But they lied to me! They used me!” </p>
  	<p class = story> “Who, Kassandra? Who did?” Lilah asked, her voice soft now as well. </p>
  	<p class = story> “The heroes, of course,” Kassandra said, smiling slightly. “Your captain, Tom, and all the other captains, that’s who. They wanted her dead, simple as that.” </p>
  	<p class = story>Lilah took a few steps back. </p>
  	<p class = story> “<i>No</i>, that’s not possible,” she said. </p>
  <p class = story>Kassandra didn’t need to use her powers to understand the pain Lilah was feeling. It was written all over her face, and it was pain that the telepath knew well. It was the kind of pain that came from betrayal. The sting that came with it, the lingering doubt, the questioning of everything a person thought they knew. </p>
  	<p class = story>And Kassandra realized that, strangely enough, she felt sorry for the woman. </p>
  <p class = story>And so she told Lilah everything. Every word that Tom had spoken to her, every false promise he’d made, everything she’d gleaned from his tightly protected mind. </p>
  	<p class = story>As she finished, the flames around her vanished. She looked curiously at Lilah. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Thank you,” was all the woman said as she turned to walk away. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Wait!” Kassandra called out. “If revenge is what you want, then let me help you!” </p>
  	<p class = story>Lilah turned around to face her. </p>
  	<p class = story> “No, revenge isn’t what I want. It’s justice. I’ll expose Tom, I’ll expose all of them. I’ll make sure that the world knows of their crimes and the kind of people they are. That, will be my revenge,” she said. </p>
  	<p class = story> “After everything you know, you’ll just let them live?” Kassandra snapped. “<i>They deserve to die!</i>” </p>
  	<p class = story> “They deserve to feel the pain of having their names dragged through the mood, to feel the hatred of the city, to have their names wiped away just as yours was, Kassandra,” Lilah said, her voice firm. “That is the pain that they will feel. And with them gone, we’ll have a new generation of heroes. True heroes. Just like the Scarlet Speedstresses. ” </p>
  	<p class = story> “No,” Kassandra growled. “They will feel pain. But of a different kind. Physical, agonizing pain, just before they die. And you will bring it to them. <i>All of them</i>.”
  	<p class = story>Kassandra struck out with her mind, using the full extent of her powers to hammer down on that one weak spot she had felt. </p>
  	<p class = story>Whatever mental protections Lilah had built shattered, and Kassandra suddenly had full access to her mind, every memory, every feeling. Kassandra felt the deep-rooted pain of having betrayed a loved one, of trying to find him as he was being hunted down by everyone else, of trying to help him but ultimately failing, just as if it were her own. Lilah fell to her knees, clutching her head. </p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra kicked her in the stomach and as Lilah fell, grabbed the conductor’s baton and backed up a few steps. </p>
  	<p class = story>It was marvelous. The telepath that had entered her mind last had been unbelievable powerful, carving a tunnel into the woman’s mind that Kassandra could follow, deeper into the mind than she had ever been. This deep, she knew, instinctively, that she could do more than suggest, as she used to be able to do. She could <i>command</i>. </p>
  	<p class = story> “<i>Everyone who is guilty must die</i>,” she told Lilah. “<i>Kill them all, every last one of them.</i>”</p>
  	<p class = story>Kassandra smiled. She would drop Lilah’s baton a short distance away, far enough for her to hide again before the fire-starter regained her source of power. As she began to turn around, Lilah looked up at her. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Everyone who is guilty must die,” she said, her voice monotone. The conductor’s baton in Kassandra’s hand suddenly grew uncomfortably hot. </p>
  	<p class = story>The last thing Kassandra saw were violet flames exploding out of her own hands before her entire body was nothing but fire and the incredible pain that came with it. </p>
  	<p class = story>There was a searing agony, and then there was nothing. </p>
