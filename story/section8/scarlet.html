		<h2> Ayano </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> A man lay face down inside the alleyway, blood pooling into the crystalline snow around him. Ayano stood just outside the narrow passageway between what had used to be convenience and electronic stores.  Both were closed down due to the storm, along with many other stores along the avenue. </p>
<p class = story> He was a large man as best she could tell, possibly too large for her to carry directly to the hospital. Dark shadows covered the alleyway, making it difficult for her to tell whether he was still breathing. If she were to judge just based on the amount of blood however, she was too late. His clothes seemed slightly ragged from a distance. There was nothing about him that suggested he was worth robbing. Killing out of cold blood? </p>
<p class = story> She frowned, wondering why anyone would be walking around out here in the first place. It was a part of the city abandoned for the most part due to its proximity to the Charred Streets. If Ayano looked down the avenue she could see a large wall in the distance that marked off a part of the city, separating it from the rest. Once that area had been a residential neighborhood, but now it was a blight on their city, full of traumatizing memories for most people. Written on the walls she knew, even though she was much too far to see it, were the names of the 958 civilians that had died in there. Even in the dark she could make out the charred remains of buildings peeking up over the wall. So why had he gone walking in the area? And why was he left dead in an alleyway? </p>
<p class = story>  <i> When your shift is done, it’s not your job to take any calls. Leave it to the other heroes on patrol. </i> </p>
<p class = story> Ayano clenched her gloved fists tightly. </p>
<p class = story> When she had first taken over the mantle of the Scarlet Speedstress, she had appreciated Tom’s guidance. At their first meeting, he seemed like the man that her mother had described: a hero that gladly accepted individuals deemed dangerous because of their powers or their lack of control over them, offering them a spot in his own patrol without hesitation. Over the months that she’d been a part of his patrol, however, she saw his mannerisms shift. He grew colder, more prone to outbursts of anger. </p>
<p class = story> Part of that shift she attributed to the implementation of the commission system soon after she had first started patrols. She had seen how other heroes frantically scrambled to bring in as many criminals as possible just to fatten their paychecks a bit. She despised the system for what she had seen it do to other heroes, how it brought out their selfishness, and if anything, she was disappointed that Tom was no exception to the rule. </p>
<p class = story>  But that’s why she would press onward, refusing to give into the system to show them all, to show Tom that there was a better way. </p>
<p class = story> And so she stepped into the alleyway, her foot pressing down into the snow. The <i>crunch</i> of her boots made her stop as something occurred to her. Why were there no footprints around the body? The snow was smooth, with mounds here and there, but nothing that would suggest an attacker running <i>away</i> from the body. </p>
<p class = story> It was when she felt her feet lose contact with the ground that she realized she might be in trouble. </p>
