<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Within a few seconds every flammable object in the bar was alight in a purple blaze. Tom watched in horror as chairs and tables erupted into flame. After roaring to life, the fire moved unnaturally, moving through the air to cut off paths to the door and chasing fleeing heroes. Tom saw Shard in the distance, currents of water swirling around her until her own costume burst into flame, and in the moment she lost control, another wave of flame swept up from the floor to consume her. Cries of pain rose in a twisted symphony as the fire consumed everyone and everything around it. </p>
  	<p class = story> And yet Tom found himself unharmed, the flames giving him and Enzo a wide berth, the flammable objects around them left unscathed. He could only wait, and eventually the flames parted way as <i>she</i> stepped through. Lilah stood untouched by the fire, dark patches of ashes spotting her costume. Her eyes were on him, and him only. Tom searched them, looking for the hero he remembered, but her eyes were blank and empty as they stared back. She looked back at him and tilted her head, as if studying him in curiosity. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Ah, Tom!” She exclaimed after a moment, smiling now. “I’m glad you’re here, I was afraid I would have to go searching for you elsewhere.” </p>
  <p class = story>  The fire around her surged forward a bit, and Tom could feel the heat growing uncomfortably against his skin. He slowly began reaching around his back, but Enzo stood up, standing between him and Lilah. His clenched hands were shaking, arcs of electricity sparking along his arms. </p>
