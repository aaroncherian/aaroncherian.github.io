<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Tom made his move. He stood up, reaching for the weapon he had been carrying with him from its holster behind his back, intent on cutting Lilah off. It was her instinct, honed after years of experience that saved her as she tracked his movement in her peripheral vision. Tom knew because it was that same instinct that saved his life the moment after.
<p class = story> Lilah instantly dodged to the side, and Tom saw the fire come alive. He rolled over the table to the other side, the scorching heat he felt on one side of his body letting him know that he had just barely escaped certain incineration. The flames began to circle him in the air, caging him in with the promise of a painful death. </p>
	<p class = story> Lilah turned to him, shaking her head. “No, no Tom, I’ll be getting to you in just a bit. Now-“ </p>
	<p class = story> The sizzling bolt of electricity struck her in the side, and she slumped to the ground. </p>
