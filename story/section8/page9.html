  <p class = story> Tom sprang up, reaching behind his back for the holster where he kept his weapon, intent on cutting Lilah off. But it was her instinct, honed after years of experience that saved her as she tracked his movement in her peripheral vision. Tom knew because it was that same instinct that saved his life the moment after.
<p class = story> Lilah instantly dodged to the side, and Tom saw the fire come alive. He rolled over the table to the other side, the scorching heat he felt on one side of his body letting him know that he had just barely escaped certain incineration. The flames began to circle him in the air, caging him in with the promise of a painful death. </p>
	<p class = story> Lilah turned to him, shaking her head. “No, no Tom, I’ll be getting to you in just a bit. Now-“ </p>
	<p class = story> The sizzling bolt of electricity struck her in the side, and she slumped to the ground. </p>
  <p class = story> It was a powerful shock, but far from the worst Tom had seen Enzo deliver. The fire around them shrunk noticeably, and Tom took the opportunity to step out behind Enzo. </p>
  <p class = story> “Don’t touch… him.” Enzo took a step closer to her. </p>
