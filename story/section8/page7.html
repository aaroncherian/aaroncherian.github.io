  <p class = story> Lilah looked at him, and it was that moment that Tom remembered everything, his memories striking him like a thunderbolt. He became aware of every detail he had missed as he realized the horrifying truth behind it all. </p>
    <p class = story> <i> No, please, that can't be what happened </i> </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah’s face contorted in anger upon seeing him for the briefest of moments, before returning to that placid expression again. </p>
  <p class = story> “Tell me, Tom, did you enjoy watching all of us fall apart after you set her up to die?” She spoke the fatal words, her voice deliberately calm but sharp as a knife. </p>
<p class = story> The older Tom, the man living his memory again, felt sick as the words twisted into him. </p>
