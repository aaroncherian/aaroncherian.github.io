  <p class = story> Lilah looked at him. </p>
  <p class = story> And that moment Tom remembered it all.</p>
  <p class = story> Lilah’s face contorted in anger momentarily before returning to the same placid expression.</p>
	<p class = story> The shroud over his mind lifted and every detail that he had missed came back to him.</p>
  	<p class = story> Enzo looked back at Tom in confusion. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom felt sick to his stomach as he realized why the Ayano had died that night. </p>
  <p class = story> “Tell me, Tom, did you enjoy watching all of us fall apart after you set her up to die?” Lilah spoke the fatal words, her voice deliberately calm but twisting into him like a knife. </p>
