<p class = story> Lilah slowly slid up the wall, leaning against it for support. </p>
<p class = story> “Why didn’t you realize, Enzo? How could you not have known what he did? That’s why you’re guilty.” She spoke as the fire dissipated, a charred, unrecognizable husk falling to the ground. </p>
<p class = story> “Yes, everyone who’s guilty needs to die. But don’t worry, there’s only one more now,” Lilah said softly. Tom seized on her distraction to pull out his weapon. </p>
<p class = story> Lilah looked back towards Tom, and found herself staring down the barrel of a gun. </p>
<p class = story> His hands were trembling as he held it, but from anger, grief or shock he wasn’t sure. Sweat ran down his face, and it threatened to slip from his hands, but he would not miss, that much he was sure of. </p>
<p class = story> “<i>You killed him! He was innocent, like all the heroes you just murdered!</i>” He shouted. </p>
<p class = story> “Don’t talk to me about killing innocent heroes Tom,” Lilah spat out. “No one here was innocent. How many of those so-called heroes tried to get justice for Ayano, the only actual hero among us? None. But when you called down a manhunt on Bryan not one person here stopped to ask whether he was innocent or not. </p>
<p class = story> “Heroes like you and Shard? You were all an infection to this city, to every hero here. And anyone who stood against you died for it. What I’m doing isn’t right, it’s what’s necessary for this city. The people of this city deserve real heroes, not whatever we’ve become.” </p>
<p class = story> “We <i>are</i> heroes. What Shard, the other captains, and I did? It was what we needed to do to keep the other heroes here in this city, protecting it.” Tom said. </p>
<p class = story> “Why? Why Ayano?” Lilah asked. </p>
