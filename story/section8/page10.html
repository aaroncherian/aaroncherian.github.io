<div class ="textbox">
<p class = story> Lilah groaned in pain. She made the effort to stand up, but failing that crouched on the ground, looking up at the two of them as she held onto her side, clutching the ruined remains of her costume. Her breathing came out in short pained spurts, but she was still smiling. </p>
	<p class = story> “It was Shard and Tom who organized it, but other team leaders had a part in it too,” Lilah gasped out. “They gave an enemy of the first Scarlet Speedstress a chance for revenge. They made an anonymous call close enough to the bar, they knew that our Scarlet Speedstress wouldn’t think twice about going. If she lived, no one was the wiser, and maybe she would think twice about speeding off by herself, but they wanted her to die.” </p>
	<p class = story> Tom could feel his heart speeding up, how had she learned it all? Enzo paused, stopping just a few feet away from her, and Lilah took it as an invitation to continue. </p>
	<p class = story> “Tom always made a big deal about not letting Bryan into his head. And when it came down to it, what did he work harder at, Lorenzo, hunting down Ayano’s killer, or hunting down Bryan?” </p>
	<p class = story> Enzo stood still for a few moments longer, and Tom wished he could see Enzo’s expression to get an inkling of what he believed. Slowly, Enzo turned back towards Tom, confusion and doubt written all over his face. </p>
	<p class = story>  “Tom?” Was all he was able to ask before he burned. </p>
