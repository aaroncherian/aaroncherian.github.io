  <p class = story> The darkness expanded out from where Enzo stood as every lamp around him lost power. Even the light streaming through the windows of the bar was quickly diminishing. Tom turned to look out the window behind him and saw darkness flooding the city. It started with the streetlamps, but slowly the lights in all the buildings around them began to disappear. The only light in the bar now came from the purple haze of the flame, and the dark blue illumination from the electricity that was gathering around Enzo, rising up out of the ground and dancing around his body. He hunched over and in the dim light it seemed to Tom that he had become more beast than man.  </p>
  	<p class = story> <i>“You won’t kill anyone else!” </i> Enzo snarled. With each word electricity wildly struck out in different directions. Lilah remained completely calm and unflinching in face of the electrical storm before her. And examining her face as well as Tom could in the poor light, it almost seemed as if she was <i>bored</i>. </p>
  	<p class = story> Enzo stretched his arms out and began to draw electricity into them, growing brighter as electricity began to concentrate around them, and Tom instinctively took a step back. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Oh, just one second before you fry everything in here Lorenzo,” Lilah suddenly said, her face tilting to the side again. “Wouldn’t you like to know who was really responsible for Ayano’s death?” </p>
