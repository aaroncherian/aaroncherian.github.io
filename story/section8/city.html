		<h2> The City </h2>
  </div>

<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Eileen glanced out the window before making the call. </p>
 	<p class = story> She was answered almost immediately. </p>
<p class = story>“This isn’t the best time, Madame Mayor,” the man on the other end of the call said. </p>
	<p class = story> “I know, James,” she said. “There was a breakout, wasn’t there?” </p>
	<p class = story>  “Of course you would know about it already, why am I even surprised?” James asked. He talked quickly. Eileen knew the tone of voice well, he was no doubt running around and giving orders to his officers up until the moment she had called. </p>
	<p class = story>  “Two days,” he continued. “Just <i>two</i> days since that damn psychotic hero burned down the bar and every hero inside, and the city’s already gone to hell.” </p>
	<p class = story>  “You couldn’t have stopped it from happening, James. We always talked about how something like this was inevitable,” Eileen responded, looking out the window again. </p>
	<p class = story>  “Yeah, but neither of us actually wanted to believe it,” James responded. “Almost every hero dead and now every criminal decides that it’s their God-given right to rule the city. I have officers patrolling, but we’re spread too thin. Someone busted the prisons too. Every criminal, that we worked to put behind bars? Free, just like that.” </p>
	<p class = story> He paused for a few moments. </p>
	<p class = story> “Why didn’t we retire when we had the chance, Eileen? Why’d I stay on as sheriff, and why’d you run for another term? We could have been done with all of this.” </p>
	<p class = story> Eileen laughed softly, </p>
	<p class = story> “Because we knew the city needed us, James. Because when something went wrong, neither of us wanted to be on the sidelines.” </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>

	<p class = story> Darrell looked around the corner before signaling the all-clear to his daughter. She nodded, and they both stepped out. Neither of them spoke a word. </p>
	<p class = story> The heroes were gone, and there was no one left to protect them from the gangs and criminals running rampant across the city. And that’s why they were running while they had the chance, because everyone knew it would only get worse from there. </p>
	<p class = story> Darrell glanced over at his daughter and gave her a reassuring smile. Ainsley was only fourteen years old, but she understood the gravity of their situation. </p>
	<p class = story>  The streets weren’t safe anymore, for anyone. They were patrolled, not be heroes any longer, but by muggers and murderers. </p>
	<p class = story> They turned onto a side street. </p>
	<p class = story> It was just the two of them, they had left everything behind. </p>
<p class = story> Darrell’s heart sank as three figures emerged in the distance and blocked their path. </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>
<p class = story> While he spoke with the mayor, James looked around at the pitiful state of the heroes in the station. It was a relatively small group when compared to the populations of heroes that had existed just two days prior. Twenty heroes. Twenty super-powered individuals against an entire city full of escaped convicts and felons. </p>
<p class = story>  Most of the heroes that had been away from the bar that night had died in the aftermath of its destruction, trying to stop the violence that followed as people slowly began to realize that there were no heroes to hold them accountable for their actions anymore. </p>
<p class = story>  These heroes had been the only ones to make it out of the bar. They had barely spoken a word since then, eyes empty and blank. From what he could gather, they had only escaped because their captain had sacrificed herself to open a path out of the bar for them. Shard, they said, was her name. James had met her several times before. She had served the city well. </p>
<p class = story> He sighed before speaking into the phone again.  </p>
<p class = story>  “The city does need us, but I’m not sure how much there is that we can do,” he said. “Now, I’m sure you didn’t call just to check up on me. What is it that you know?” </p>
<p class = story> He could hear Eileen laughing softly again. </p>
<p class = story>  “You know me too well, James,” she said. Then her voice became solemn. “They’re coming.” </p>
<p class = story> “Heroes? From other cities?” He asked, allowing himself, briefly, to hope. </p>
<p class = story> “No, quite the opposite actually. Small-time crooks, villains, gangs, all of them are coming for the city. For <i>us</i>,” she said the statement in typical matter-of-fact tone of voice that refused to betray even a hint of panic. </p>
<p class = story> “Are you sure?” </p>
<p class = story> “I am, James. They’re coming from everywhere, other cities, even from across the country.” </p>
<p class = story> James examined the heroes around him again. </p>
<p class = story> Although he wasn’t sure they could be called heroes anymore. They stood and sat there in normal civilian clothing, looking lost and frightened. </p>
<p class = story> No, James decided, these were just people with powers that were in way over their heads. </p>
-----
<p class = story> Darrell stepped out in front of Ainsley immediately. The three figures stepped out into view. Two men, one woman. The woman was carrying a baseball bat in hand. </p>
<p class = story>“Look,” she said. “They thought they could leave without saying goodbye.” </p>
	<p class = story> “Indeed,” the man to her left said. “Don’t they know that there’s a toll to pay if they want to leave?” </p>
 <p class = story>
  	Darrell’s heart started to beat faster. </p>
<p class = story>“Please, we didn’t take anything with us,” he said quietly. </p>
	<p class = story> The man on the right of the woman shook his head. </p>
<p class = story>“Well that’s just disappointing. I guess we’ll have to make an example of you so people they answer to now. <i>We</i> own these streets.” </p>
	<p class = story>  Darrell felt Ainsley grab hold of him. </p>
	<p class = story> “We can run,” she whispered. “The path behind us is clear.” </p>
	<p class = story> He felt a surge of pride, oddly, even amidst the terror he felt. She at least, still had her head on straight. </p>
	<p class = story> And in that moment he made his decision. There was another option, one that he had dreaded. But if it would let his little girl survive…</p>
	<p class = story> For the first time in his life Darrell embraced his powers. </p>
	<p class = story> “Run Ainsley!” He shouted out. He reached out with his mind and grabbed ahold of the woman’s bat. </p>
	<p class = story> Although Darrell himself wasn’t aware of it, there was a smile on his face as the bat ripped itself out of the woman’s head and smacked her upside the head. </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>
<p class = story> Eileen slowly started taking out files from her desk. The three security guards inside the office looked on impassively as she threw them in the nearest trashcan. She opened another drawer and placed an umbrella on top of her desk as well. </p>
<p class = story> “And reinforcement heroes from other cities?” James asked her. </p>
<p class = story> “No city wants to risk their own heroes by sending them into this mess. We’re on our own.” Eileen said as she continued to fill the trashcan. She moved it from its position by the desk to the middle of the room. She covered the phone for a moment. </p>
<p class = story> “Would any of you happen to have a lighter?” She asked. One man shrugged, digging into his pocket and tossing one to her. </p>
<p class = story> “If that’s the case, then so be it,” James said. “I’ll send a group of officers to bring you over here, it’s too risky to keep ourselves separated right now.” </p>
<p class = story> “You will do no such thing,” Eileen said immediately. </p>
<p class = story>  She looked out the window again, where two stories below a man stood among the bodies of what had been the bulk of her personal security detail, surrounded by patches of fire. A spinning orb of flame formed over her outstretched hand. Then he looked up at her and smiled, before walking into the building. </p>
<p class = story> “You wouldn’t get here in time anyway,” she said. </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>
	<p class = story> Ainsley ran a few yards down the street before she realized that her father had not followed her. When she looked back, he was still in the same spot, but he was hunched over at an awkward angle. He should have fallen forward, the way he was leaning over, but something was keeping him upright. </p>
	<p class = story> That thing was a spike of concrete that had erupted out from the ground and impaled him through the chest.</p>
	<p class = story> There was no emotion, only a strange numbness as Ainsley stumbled back. One of the men waved, and the concrete suddenly encased Ainsley’s feet. The group began to walk over to her, one of the men supporting the woman. </p>
	<p class = story> She so dearly wanted to cry, to let herself fall to the ground. </p>
	<p class = story> But then she would die. </p>
	<p class = story>  Ainsley clenched her fists, and started looking for loose objects around her. Pieces of glass that were littering the street began to slowly rise into the air.  </p>
	<p class = story>  She would not die tonight. </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>
<p class = story>  Eileen set fire to the paper in the trashcan. It caught, slowly but surely. </p>
	<p class = story>  “Oh, Eileen,” James breathed into the phone as he finally realized why she had called. </p>
	<p class = story> She smiled. </p>
	<p class = story> “This is goodbye, James. I’m afraid there’s no escaping this one.” </p>
	<p class = story> “No! We can still-“ </p>
	<p class = story> “What you will do is save the people of this city,” Eileen interjected. “You can’t save them all, but I know what you’re capable of. This is our home, and even if you can’t protect all of it, you will make sure that even one section remains a safe haven for our people. I’m leaving it to you, James.” </p>
	<p class = story> “I understand, Madame Mayor,” he responded, his voice wavering only the slightest bit. </p>
	<p class = story> “Thank you James.” </p>
<p class = story> She cut the call. </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>
<p class = story>  Ainsley refused to show fear as the group of three walked closer to her. </p>
<p class = story> She refused to cry as she saw her father’s body behind them. </p>
	<p class = story> She refused to give up. </p>
	<p class = story> But then she felt a strange calmness. An acceptance of the situation, and an understanding that everything would be alright. </p>
	<p class = story> The three people in front of her, on the other hand, had a very different reaction. Their eyes went wide with fear as they all stepped back. One of the men started crying out in horror at something no one else could see. </p>
	<p class = story> And just like that, one of the men and the woman slumped to the ground, eyes shut as they collapsed. </p>
	<p class = story>  The other man suddenly stood up straight and looked over at her, his face void of emotion. His hand twitched and the concrete around Ainsley’s shoes crumbled away. The spike propping up her father’s body fell apart as well. </p>
	<p class = story> The man then joined his companions on the floor. </p>
<p class = story>  Ainsley saw another man step out from the distance. He said nothing, and yet somehow she felt a sense of security. </p>
<p class = story> It was strange, but she knew that with the man she would be safe. </p>
<p class = story> She walked over to her father’s body and fell to her knees. </p>
<p class = story> The man stood guard over the girl as she cried for her father. </p>
<p class = story id = 'dashes'> --------- </p>
<p class = story> “It makes no sense for the three of you to remain here,” Eileen told her guards. “The man is after me and me only.” </p>
	<p class = story> She saw the protest on their faces but cut them off. </p>
	<p class = story> “That was not a request. I thank you for your service, but it’s time for you to leave while you still can.” Eileen looked over to the burning trashcan, the smoke from which was rising directly into the smoke detector above it. </p>
            <p class = story>	“That should buy you some time,” she said. </p>
	<p class = story> The guards were clearly uneasy, but acquiesced to her request. The last guard stopped just before the door, coming back to shake Eileen’s hand briefly and whisper a final ‘thank you’ before leaving. </p>
	<p class = story>  The fire alarms started to ring throughout the building shortly afterwards, and as the water started to spray down from the ceiling sprinklers, Eileen opened her umbrella and held it above her head. </p>
<p class = story> There was no sense in being wet and miserable as she died, after all. </p>
 <p class = story>She strode over to her desk and sat down on her chair, swiveling so she faced the door. </p>
	<p class = story> And there Eileen waited for the end. </p>
