<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> She turned around.</p>
<p class = story> “What do you think is actually happening here, Tom?” She asked as she walked back to the table.</p>
<p class = story> Tom examined her for a few seconds. He thought back to the memory he had just experienced, and as best as he could remember now, Lilah had walked right out the bar.</p>
<p class = story> “You're not real,” he finally responded.</p>
<p class = story> Lilah seemed surprised by the statement. </p>
<p class = story> “Figured that much out already, have you? Good, that makes this easier. We can skip past the part where I explain to you that I'm a figment of your mind.” She finally took a seat across from Tom, eyeing him curiously.</p>
<P class = story> Tom shrugged before speaking. </p>
<p class = story> “It makes sense. You aren't the Lilah from the memory I just experienced, she didn't walk back to to the table, and the Lilah from my present is sitting right across from me with the others in the <i>actual</i> bar.”</p>
<p class = story> Disappointment crossed Lilah’s face.</p>
<p class = story> “Is that so? Close, Tom, but you haven't quite figured it out yet. But maybe this time at least, you'll understand more than you have before.”</p>
<p class = story>
  Tom leaned forward.
</p>
<p class = story>  "You seem to be implying that we've had this conversation before, and yet I don't remember any such thing. What exactly is happening here? You are a part of my mind, correct? Tell me, why am I living through my memories? How is that even possible? Why am I having a conversation with you, when you're essentially my own mind?,” he replied.</p>
<p class = story> Lilah leaned forward as well,</p>
<p class = story> “Is it really that odd to be having a conversation with yourself, Tom? People do it all the time, imagining what their loved ones might say if they were there with them.”</p>
<p class = story> “But never quite to the extremes that I'm experiencing now,” Tom responded evenly. "And you're ignoring my questions." </p>
<p class = story> “That's because I can't," Lilah said, leaning back. </p>
<p class = story> “<i>Don’t screw with me!</i>" Tom snapped. "I’m being pulled between past and present for reasons I don’t know and I'd like some answers. <i>This isn’t how the mind works</i>. There’s nothing that should be stopping you from telling me what’s happening.”</p>
<p class = story> “There shouldn’t be,” Lilah replied softly. “And yet there is. We don’t have much time here before you’re pulled into the next memory. I'm the part of you that remembers it all, Tom, and this is the best I can do to help you realize what's happening." </p>
 <p class = story> As she spoke, Tom began to realize something. Lilah had said another memory was coming, and yet each of the memories had come after he had woken up again at the bar with his teammates. He had assumed it had been a pattern, and this didn't follow. </p>
