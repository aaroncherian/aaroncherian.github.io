  <p class = story> She turned around and began to walk towards the table.</p>
<p class = story> “What do you think is actually happening here, Tom?”</p>
<p class = story> Tom examined her for a few seconds. He checked how much he remembered of after Lilah had walked away from him that day. The memory was fairly clear. Lilah had walked right out the bar.</p>
<p class = story> “I don’t think you’re real,” he finally responded.</p>
<p class = story> Lilah raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p>
<p class = story> “So you’ve figured that much out already. At least this time we can skip past the part where I explain that I’m just a part of your imagination.” She finally took a seat across from Tom, eyeing him impassively.</p>
<p class = story> “It makes sense, you’re not the Lilah from the memory, and the real Lilah is sitting across from me with the others in the actual bar right now.”</p>
<p class = story> Disappointment crossed Lilah’s face.</p>
<p class = story> “Well, it looks like you haven’t figured it all out yet. But maybe this time at least we’ll get farther than before.”</p>
<p class = story> “You keep talking like we’ve had this conversation before. What exactly is happening here? You’re just a figment of me, right? If you know what’s going on that means deep down I do too, which means you should have no problem explaining everything to me,” Tom said leaning forward.</p>
<p class = story> Lilah looked away,</p>
<p class = story> “I… I can’t do that, Tom. I’d like to, but I can’t.”</p>
<p class = story> “Then why are you even here?” Tom snapped. </p>
<p class = story> “Because I’m the part of you that remembers everything, Tom. And this is the best I can do to help you realize what’s really happening.” </p>
<p class = story> “Don’t screw with me. I’m being pulled between past and present for reasons I don’t know and I’m through with it. This isn’t how the mind works. There’s nothing that should be stopping you from telling me what’s happening,” Tom said, his frustration and anger finally surfacing. </p>
<p class = story> “There shouldn’t be,” Lilah said sadly. “And yet there is. We don’t have much time here Tom before you’re pulled into the next memory. </p>
 <p class = story> It was as after she spoke that Tom finally began to realize what he hadn’t before. </p>
