<div class ="textbox">
  <p class = story> Lilah turned around.</p>
<p class = story> “We don’t have a lot of time, so let’s make the most of it,” she said in a tone not frigid, as it was before, but tired. </p>
	<p class = story> Lilah began to walk back towards the table. Her footsteps echoed through the empty bar. </p>
	<p class = story> Tom took a moment to examine her. She was still dressed in costume, her suit jacket pressed and clean, painted in dark purple tones. She held her conductors baton loosely in one hand. A good portion of it was entirely charred and darkened by ash. </p>
	<p class = story><i> No that’s wrong. She had gotten a new one recently.</i> </p>
	<p class = story> And then as Tom watched, the baton changed. The dirt and grime on the baton faded away as if someone had taken a wet napkin to it, leaving him startled, to say the least where he sat.  </p>
	<p class = story> Lilah stopped in her tracks and examined it, her eyes wide. </p>
	<p class = story> “So,” Lilah sighed, “have you figured it out then?” </p>
	<p class = story> Tom looked up at the lights hanging from the ceiling. They brightened and dimmed at his will. He looked out the window, and as he imagined it, day transitioned to night, cloudy darkness covering the sky. Lilah stood there all the while, watching him. </p>
	<p class = story> “It’s not real,” Tom whispered. “This…conversation, it’s happening in my head. You aren’t the real Lilah.” </p>
	<p class = story> Lilah smiled slightly before resuming her walk and taking a seat across from Tom. While on the surface she seemed calm, he got the sense that she was surprised by his statement. She then reclined back in her chair. </p>
	<p class = story> “What’s happening to me?” Tom asked quietly. </p>
	<p class = story> “If I could explain it to you, I would,” Lilah responded. “Although if it was as easy as that, we wouldn’t be having this conversation then, would we?” </p>
	<p class = story> “No,” she continued after a moment, answering her own question. “No, we wouldn’t be. I’m just a part of you that’s been locked away, trying to guide you as best I can.” </p>
	<p class = story> “Locked away? Why?” </p>
	<p class = story> “Because I remember it all,” she said. “I remember everything you don’t.” </p>
	<p class = story> “I want to remember,” Tom replied his voice urgent. “I want to remember <i>her</i> death. To forget it feels like I’m dishonoring her.” </p>
<p class = story> He looked down at the table, and pieces of a red mask were splintered across it. Tom shut his eyes tightly, willing them to disappear. The table was clean when he opened them.  </p>
<p class = story> Lilah’s expression was unreadable as she looked down at where the shards of the mask had been strewn. </p>
<p class = story> “I want to remember who killed her,” Tom continued. “I want to remember what happened to the rest of <i>us</i>, and how we ended up sitting at the bar together seven years later honoring her memory. But above the rest of it, I want to know how, for that moment, I could just <i>forget</i> Ayano’s death, how I could pretend that she was alive and with the rest of us in the bar.” </p>
<p class = story> Tom felt his muscles freeze. Panic spiked through him, but the sensation faded away. And yet he could still feel it, underneath the surface, waiting. </p>
<p class = story> There was disappointment across Lilah’s face. </p>
<p class = story> “Oh Tom, you haven’t realized-” She started, but Tom cut her off. </p>
