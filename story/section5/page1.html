  <p class = story> Something about that sentence rang strangely in Tom’s mind. He frowned, because as far as he could remember, Lilah had just walked out the door all those years ago. No, she had never stopped to ask him anything else. </p>
  	<p class = story> “What do you mean, weird?” Tom asked, his mouth completely dry. Lilah turned around and looked at him. </p>
  	<p class = story> Around Tom, everything was shifting. </p>
  <p class = story> Lights grew slightly dimmer, conversational chatter diminishing as the tables of heroes in the bar began to fade out of existence, leaving him and Lilah alone. Both their costumes disappeared, and they were back in their civilian clothing. Tom looked around frantically. Every detail pointed to the fact that they were in the present now. She shrugged spreading her arms around her, </p>
  	<p class = story> “I mean, all of this? Look, now we’re back in the present again, and now it’s just a bit emptier and just a bit quieter than before. Bryan and Enzo are now mysteriously absent. The entire thing is pretty inconsistent honestly. Hasn’t it occurred to you yet that none of this is actually real?” She asked. </p>
  	<p class = story> “I’ve… considered it, but has it occurred to you what this might mean for me if it’s not?” Tom responded. </p>
  	<p class = story> Lilah shrugged. </p>
  	<p class = story> “Probably means you’re insane.” </p>
  	<p class = story> “What’s happening to me?” Tom whispered. Lilah was unresponsive. She simply looked at him, almost pityingly. </p>
  	<p class = story> Tom felt a familiar anger growing inside him. How could she just stand there, looking down on him like that? </p>
