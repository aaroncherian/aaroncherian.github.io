  	<p class = story> “Ah, there’s the anger Tom. Why is it I never realized what an angry person you were?” </p>
  	<p class = story> <i>“What the hell does that mean?” </i> Tom shouted, slamming his palms down on the table as he stood up. Lilah looked mildly startled, </p>

Bryan sat across next to Lilah now, all three of them in costume, but everything around them was still, frozen in time. </p>
