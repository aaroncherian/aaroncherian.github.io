  <p class = story> “The reunion never happened, did it?” He asked with growing horror. </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah’s head snapped up.</p>
  <p class = story>“How did you know?” She demanded.</p>
<p class = story> “I thought there was a pattern. That I was just dozing off at our reunion and I would wake up between memories,” Tom responded, his voice quiet at first, but firmer as he spoke. “But then there was this, talking to you, someone that doesn’t exist in a place that doesn’t exist. Which means that either there is no pattern, or that I wasn't seeing the correct pattern. I've never really been waking up after all of these memories, have I? It's just been one continued hallucination.”</p>
<p class = story> Lilah nodded rapidly. Her face lit up in a happy expression that was a stark contrast to the shock Tom was feeling.</p>
<p class = story> “This is good, this is really good Tom. I’ll be able to use this next time. Even if you don’t remember, I will. We’ll be that much closer to breaking out,” she said.</p>
<p class = story>  Tom tried to respond but as he did he felt his muscles grow rigid.</p>
