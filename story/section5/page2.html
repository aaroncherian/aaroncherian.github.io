<p class = story> “But here you are, sitting right in front of me, telling me that you’re the part of me with all the memories that I’m missing, and you can’t explain it to me?” His voice grew in strength as he spoke. <i>“You think I want to forget? That I want to be pushed through one memory and another?</i> And the worst part is, that all the while you sit here <i>pretending to be</i> her!” </p> 
  <p class = story> His voice cracked towards the end, and Tom realized he had been shouting. </p>
  <p class = story> “I take her appearance because it’s always the one that you’ve responded best to.” Lilah’s voice was quiet. </p>
  <p class = story> Tom sat in silence as the implications of her sentence became clear to him. </p>
  <p class = story> “This isn’t the first time, is it?” He asked, horrified. “Are you telling me that we- I’ve been here before? Having this conversation with you? Living through these memories?” </p>
  <p class = story> “Yes. It’s always the same,” Lilah said tersely, her voice hardening. “At first, you didn’t realize that anything was out of the ordinary as you flitted from memory to memory. But at one point, you noticed that maybe something was wrong, and that gave me a chance. Just the smallest of windows to slip through to see you, to tell you the truth. </p>
  <p class = story> “But it wasn’t as simple as that, you see. Because I couldn’t just outright tell you. I tried, the first time I saw you, but it felt like something was suffocating me, keeping me from breathing, let alone speaking. And then you were gone again. So I waited for the next time. But then you didn’t even realize that this was all in your head, you thought that I was the real Lilah. That’s how far gone you were.” </p>
  <p class = story> Tom slumped back as the words bit into him. </p>
  <p class = story> “I didn’t-“ he started, but then stopped, unsure of what to say. </p>
  <p class = story> “You didn’t what?” Lilah practically snarled at him. He looked up in shock. “Remember how many times you rejected me? You say that you don’t want to forget? <i>Well you do, Tom.</i> Every time this happens, you learn the truth, and then you reject me again, and I end up back here. Do you think I want this to be happening to us?” </p>
  <p class = story> “I realized this time,” Tom protested weakly. “I realized who you were.” </p>
  <p class = story> “That…you did,” she conceded grudgingly. “It was the quickest it’s happened yet. It’s what I’d been hoping would happen for such a long time, so we could get on to the more important things. But now, I think I’ve realized that it’s pointless. We’re cowards, Tom, in the end. All we do is run.” </p>
  <p class = story> There was silence for a few moments. </p>
  <p class = story> “I’d like to return to the real bar now,” Tom finally stated. “To the reunion. Bryan will be able to figure this out for us.” </p>
  <p class = story> Lilah responded by laughing, mirthless chuckles that echoed around the bar. </p>
  <p class = story> “And still you refuse to face the truth,” she said. “The next memory is coming, Tom. There’s no returning you to the bar.” </p>
