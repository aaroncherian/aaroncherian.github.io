  <p class = story> Lilah looked at him sympathetically.</p>
  <p class = story> “I know, and I’m sorry I can’t stop it, but we’ve run out of time, Tom. But I can at least take you to the next memory.  And I can tell you one thing. There is more to Ayano’s death than you remember.”</p>
  <p class = story> She waved. There was no physical feeling of coldness this time as Tom fell into the next memory, only an icy feeling in his gut from Lilah’s last words, ones that he would have undoubtedly questioned if he could have responded. </p>
  <p class = story> The bar was full again, but there were just three of them at their table. Bryan sat next to Lilah, while Tom sat alone on the other side of the table, all three of them dressed in costume.</p>
